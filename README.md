## Recognition of STEMI by Paramedics and the Effect of Computer inTerpretation (RESPECT) study

This repo will provide all of the scripts required to reproduce the analysis in R statistics for the RESPECT pilot study.

The data is not included here, but is available by contacting admin@ambulanceresearch.co.uk

### R Statistics packages

The data preparation and analysis were conducted in RStudio, using R version 2.15.2.
The following packages are required to be installed in order for these scripts to run properly:

1. epitools
2. xtable
3. ggplot2
4. plyr
5. sqldf
6. lme4


### Thesis

The raw files as well as the final PDF are available.  The original TEX thesis template was created by Sunil Patel (http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/thesis-template/), which itself was a modified version of a thesis template by Steve Gunn (http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/srg/softwaretools/document/templates/).  It is very good and I'd thoroughly recommend using it.
