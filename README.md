## Recognition of STEMI by Paramedics and the Effect of Computer inTerpretation (RESPECT) study

This repository contains the scripts required to reproduce the analysis in R statistics for the RESPECT pilot study.

The data is not included here, but is available by contacting admin@ambulanceresearch.co.uk

### R Statistics packages

This analysis was performed using R version 3.1.2 and the checkpoint package v0.3.3.  Checkpoint will load in all of the packages that you require for this analysis with the exception of a few dependencies.  Depending on your own set-up, you may need to install these separately.

The following dependencies are not available in checkpoint (according to the warning message I received during the analysis â€“ your mileage may vary:

+ methods
+ stats
+ graphics
+ grid
+ splines
+ parallel
+ tools
+ utils

### Thesis

The raw files as well as the final PDF are available.  The original TEX thesis template was created by Sunil Patel (http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/thesis-template/), which itself was a modified version of a thesis template by Steve Gunn (http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/srg/softwaretools/document/templates/).  It is very good and I'd thoroughly recommend using it.
