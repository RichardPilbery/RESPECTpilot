## Recognition of STEMI by Paramedics and the Effect of Computer inTerpretation (RESPECT) study

This repo will provide all of the scripts required to reproduce the analysis in R statistics for the RESPECT pilot study.

The following packages are required to be installed in order for these scripts to run properly:

1. epitools (0.5-7)
2. xtable (1.7-1)
3. ggplot2 (0.9.3.1)
4. plyr (1.8.1)
5. sqldf (0.4-7)

7. epiR (0.9-57)
8. RColorBrewer (1.0-5)

The scripts used to prepare and analysis the data are available in RMarkdown format in the R folder.


### Thesis

The raw files as well as the final PDF are available.  The original TEX thesis template was created by Sunil Patel (http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/thesis-template/), which itself was a modified version of a thesis template by Steve Gunn (http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/srg/softwaretools/document/templates/).  It is very good and I'd thoroughly recommend using it.
