	Abstract = {Abstract Background. Little is known about clinically important events and advanced care treatment that patients with {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} encounter in the prehospital setting. Objectives. We sought to determine the proportion of community patients with {STEMI} who experienced a clinically important event or received advanced care treatment prior to arrival at a designated percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI)} laboratory or emergency department ({ED).} Methods. We reviewed 487 consecutive community patients with {STEMI} between May 2008 and June 2009. All patients were geographically within a single large "third-service" urban emergency medical services ({EMS)} system and were transported by paramedics with an advanced care scope of practice. We recorded predefined clinically important events and advanced care treatment that occurred in patients being transported directly to a {PCI} laboratory or {ED} (group 1) or interfacility transfer to a {PCI} laboratory (group 2). Results. One or more clinically important events occurred in 92 of 342 (26.9\%) group 1 patients and nine of 145 (6.2\%) group 2 patients. The most common were sinus bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. Additionally, 33 of 342 (9.6\%) group 1 and nine of 145 (6.2\%) group 2 patients received one or more advanced care treatments. The most common were administration of morphine and administration of atropine. Eight group 1 patients and three group 2 patients received cardiopulmonary resuscitation ({CPR)} or defibrillation. Conclusions. Clinically important events and advanced care treatment are common in community {STEMI} patients undergoing prehospital transport or interfacility transfer to a {PCI} center. Several patients required {CPR} or defibrillation. Further research is needed to define the clinical experience of {STEMI} patients during the out-of-hospital phase and the scope of practice required of {EMS} providers to safely manage these patients.

	Abstract = {Timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI)} is the preferred therapy for {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI).1} The challenge, however, lies in the definition of "timely." In general, the shorter the time from symptom onset to {PCI} is, the higher the likelihood of myocardial salvage and lower associated mortality. Studies suggest that the tipping point for when primary {PCI} is no longer superior to fibrinolytic therapy is approximately 2 hours, though the exact time depends on the duration of ischemia, the amount of myocardium in jeopardy, and the bleeding risk of the patient, among other factors.2,3 In industrialized urban settings, . . .},

	Abstract = {{UNLABELLED:} Patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain are triaged to early reperfusion therapies based on their initial 12-lead electrocardiogram ({ECG).} The standard 12-lead {ECG} lacks sensitivity to detect acute myocardial infarction ({AMI).} Electrocardiographic diagnosis of non-{ST-elevation} myocardial infarction (non-{STEMI)} is especially difficult and is delayed until cardiac biomarkers turn positive, indicating onset of myocardial necrosis., {STUDY} {AIMS:} The purpose of this analysis was to extract global {ST-T} waveform features from patients with chest pain, compare these features in patients with and without {AMI}, and then identify features that distinguish diagnostic categories., {METHODS:} This is a secondary analysis of data from the Ischemia Monitoring and Mapping in the Emergency Department in Appropriate Triage and Evaluation of Acute Ischemic Myocardium study, a prospective clinical trial in which patients were attached to Holter monitor devices to obtain 24 hours of continuous {ECG} data. Digital recordings from 176 patients were analyzed: 88 with {AMI} ({STEMI} and non-{STEMI)} and 88 without {AMI} or unstable angina. The non-acute coronary syndrome ({ACS)} group was further subdivided into those with non-{ACS} cardiac conditions such as heart failure and those without cardiac disease who had noncardiac chest pain. For each patient, 10 consecutive waveforms were obtained within the first 120 minutes of emergency department presentation. The waveforms were time-aligned to the {QRS}, signal-averaged, baseline-adjusted. {ST-T} waveforms were complied according to diagnostic category and pooled for further analysis. Eigenvector-lead feature coefficients (Karhunen-Loeve [K-L] coefficients) were obtained for each patient by taking the dot product of the {ST-T} wave ({ST} segment or entire waveform) and the first 3 common eigenvectors, producing 24 K-L coefficients. Cumulative probability distribution function curves were plotted for each diagnostic category. Statistical significance of category coefficient distribution differences was determined. Multinomial regression was used to assess accuracy of feature coefficients to predict diagnostic category., {RESULTS:} Non-{STEMI} and non-{ACS} cardiac category K-L coefficient curves were statistically different in 11 of 24 feature curves (P {\textless} .001-.047). {ST-segment} (50 samples) coefficients predicted non-{ACS} cardiac patients 11.5\% more often (P = .02) than those derived from the entire {ST-T} wave., {CONCLUSION:} Patients diagnosed with non-{STEMI} have distinct distribution of K-L coefficients compared with non-{ACS} cardiac patients. Coefficients from the first 50 samples of the {ST-T} wave ({ST} segment) better predict diagnostic category than do coefficients derived from the entire {ST-T} wave. Karhunen-Loeve coefficient feature analysis may provide early diagnostic information to distinguish patients with non-{STEMI} vs non-{ACS} cardiac patients.},

Computer constructed {ST} vector magnitude ({ST-VM)} trends were analyzed for 0.5 or greater decline from the initial {ST} amplitude ({IA)} lasting for 10 mins or longer ({ST} response) and for {ST} re-elevation 0.75 {IA} or more following {ST} decline. The degree of {ST} response, time from treatment onset and {ST-VM} re-elevation were correlated to peak creatine phosphokinase ({CPK)}, left ventricular ejection fraction ({EF)} and final {ST-VM.}, {RESULTS:} The presence of an {ST} response correlated with a lower peak {CPK} (2691 +/- 1625 versus 4057 +/- 1622 {U/L}, P = 0.043) and tended to higher {EF} (0.48 +/- 0.11 versus 0.36 +/- 0.09, P = 0.057). The {ST} responder group had fewer patients with {ST} re-elevation than the group of nonresponders (13 of 30 versus five of five patients, P = 0.041). Moreover, {ST} response before 120 mins was associated with lower peak {CPK} (2089 +/- 1299 versus 3367 +/- 177 {U/L}, P = 0.02) and better {EF} (0.54 +/- 0.06 versus 0.41 +/- 0.12, P = 0.02) compared with later or no {ST} response. The degree of {ST} response correlated significantly with a lower {ST-VM} during the last hour (r = -0.744, P = 0.001). {ST} trends showed no significant differences between treatment groups ({tPA} versus {SK).} The {tPA} group, however, tended to an overall earlier {ST} response (117 +/- 75 versus 163 +/- 64 mins, P = 0.13)., {CONCLUSIONS:} Early {ST-VM} trends are closely associated with electrocardiographic and clinical outcome and may provide a basis for clinical management, therapeutic comparisons and better insight into thrombolysis in {MI.}},

We then reviewed the algorithms proposed by Fiol et al and Tierala et al, and applied them and our own from Kanei et al using {ST} depression in {aVR} for predicting the left circumflex artery ({LCx)} as the culprit, to the population.

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Electrocardiographic methods still provide the bulk of cardiovascular diagnostics. Cardiac ischemia is associated with typical alterations in cardiac biosignals that have to be measured, analyzed by mathematical algorithms and allegorized for further clinical diagnostics. The fast growing fields of biomedical engineering and applied sciences are intensely focused on generating new approaches to cardiac biosignal analysis for diagnosis and risk stratification in myocardial ischemia., {OBJECTIVES:} To present and review the state of the art in and new approaches to electrocardiologic methods for non-invasive detection and risk stratification in coronary artery disease ({CAD)} and myocardial ischemia; secondarily, to explore the future perspectives of these methods., {METHODS:} In follow-up to the Expert Discussion at the 2008 Workshop on {"Biosignal} Analysis" of the German Society of Biomedical Engineering in Potsdam, Germany, we comprehensively searched the pertinent literature and databases and compiled the results into this review. Then, we categorized the state-of-the-art methods and selected new approaches based on their applications in detection and risk stratification of myocardial ischemia. Finally, we compared the pros and cons of the methods and explored their future potentials for cardiology., {RESULTS:} Resting {ECG}, particularly suited for detecting {ST-elevation} myocardial infarctions, and exercise {ECG}, for the diagnosis of stable {CAD}, are state-of-the-art methods. New exercise-free methods for detecting stable {CAD} include cardiogoniometry ({CGM);} methods for detecting acute coronary syndrome without {ST} elevation are Body Surface Potential Mapping, functional imaging and {CGM.} Heart rate variability and blood pressure variability analyses, microvolt T-wave alternans and signal-averaged {ECG} mainly serve in detecting and stratifying the risk for lethal arrythmias in patients with myocardial ischemia or previous myocardial infarctions. Telemedicine and ambient-assisted living support the electrocardiological monitoring of at-risk patients., {CONCLUSIONS:} There are many promising methods for the exercise-free, non-invasive detection of {CAD} and myocardial ischemia in the stable and acute phases. In the coming years, these new methods will help enhance state-of-the-art procedures in routine diagnostics. The future can expect that equally novel methods for risk stratification and telemedicine will transition into clinical routine.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of firstyear paramedic students to identify {ST-segment} elevation myocardial injury ({STEMI)} on 12-lead electrocardiograms ({ECGs)} following a three-hour presentation by a board-certified emergency medicine physician experienced in {ECG} interpretation.
{METHODS:}
Thirty-three first-year paramedic students with minimal to no experience in evaluating 12-lead {ECGs} were administered a pre-test with 20 12-lead {ECGs} and were asked to evaluate each for: (1) presence of {STEMI} ({STEMI} identification); (2) if {STEMI} presents, {ECG} leads demonstrating {ST-elevation} ({LEAD} identification); and (3) if {STEMI} present, the anatomic distribution of the {STEMI} ({ANATOMY} identification). The students were randomized into two groups. Group 1 (16 students; control group) received a handout describing the evaluation of {ECGs} for {STEMI}, while Group 2 (17 students; experimental group) received the handout plus a three hour presentation on the evaluation of {ECGs} for {STEMI.} Following randomization, distribution of the {STEMI} handout and {ECG} {STEMI} presentation, a post-test with 20 new {ECGs} was administered to all participants. The pretest and post-test mean scores were compared between the two groups to determine if attendance at the presentation improved the paramedic students' abilities to evaluate and identify {STEMI} {ECGs.} Following the {STEMI} posttest, students in Group 1 were provided with the {STEMI} lecture. Students were retested with 20 new {ECGs} five months following the initial study to examine retention of the information taught.
{RESULTS:}
The mean pre-test scores for the two groups (Group 1 vs Group 2, respectively) in {STEMI} identification (74.4 vs 75.6\%; p=0.79), lead identification (50.0 vs. 51.2\%; p=0.8) and anatomy identification (49.4 vs 51.8\%; p=0.60) were similar in all three categories. Post-test scores between Group 1 and Group 2 demonstrated statistically significant differences in {STEMI} identification (85.6 vs 92.4\%; p{\textless}0.02), lead identification (73.4 vs 85.2\%; p{\textless}0.02), and anatomy identification (65.9 vs 87.1\%; p{\textless}0.01), with Group 2 demonstrating higher mean scores relative to Group 1 in all three categories. Comparison of mean initial pre-test and five-month retest scores for all students demonstrated statistically significant differences in {STEMI} identification (75.0 vs 87.4\%; p{\textless}0.0001), lead identification (50.6 vs 82.2\%; p{\textless}0.0001), and anatomy identification (50.6 vs 76.6\%; p{\textless}0.0001).
{CONCLUSIONS:}
The ability of first-year paramedic students to accurately detect {STEMI} on prehospital 12-lead {ECGs} is enhanced by a structured {ECG} {STEMI} presentation provided by an emergency medicine physician, and these students maintained excellent retention of {STEMI} {ECG} skills over a five-month period.},

	Abstract = {Background: There have been many proposals for objective standards designed to optimize training, testing, and maintaining competency in interpretation of electrocardiograms ({ECGs).} However, most of these recommendations are consensus based and are not derived from clinical trials that include patient outcomes.  Purpose: To critically review the available data on training, accuracy, and outcomes of computer and physician interpretation of 12-lead resting {ECGs.}  Data Sources: English-language articles were retrieved by searching {MEDLINE} (1966 to 2002), {EMBASE} (1974 to 2002), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (1975-2002). The references in articles selected for analysis were also reviewed for relevance.  Study Selection: All articles on training, accuracy, and outcomes of {ECG} interpretations were analyzed.  Data Extraction: Study design and results were summarized in evidence tables. Information on physician interpretation compared to a "gold standard," typically a consensus panel of expert electrocardiographers, was extracted. The clinical context of and outcomes related to the {ECG} interpretation were obtained whenever possible.  Data Synthesis: Physicians of all specialties and levels of training, as well as computer software for interpreting {ECGs}, frequently made errors in interpreting {ECGs} when compared to expert electrocardiographers. There was also substantial disagreement on interpretations among cardiologists. Adverse patient outcomes occurred infrequently when {ECGs} were incorrectly interpreted.  Conclusions: There is no evidence-based minimum number of {ECG} interpretations that is ideal for attaining or maintaining competency in {ECG} interpretation skills. Further research is needed to clarify the optimal way to build and maintain {ECG} interpretation skills based on patient outcomes.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The electrocardiographic ({ECG)} diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction ({MI)} should be improved. This might be done either by regarding all 24 aspects (both positive and negative leads), or a subset hereof (e.g. 19-lead {ECG)}, of the conventional 12-lead {ECG} or by using additional electrodes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of the different {ECG} methods in diagnosing acute {ST-elevation} {MI.}, {METHODS:} The study population consisted of 479 patients admitted to Lund University Hospital with acute chest pain. One conventional {ECG} plus leads {V4R}, {V5R}, V8 and V9 were recorded for each patient within 24 h of admittance. Biochemical markers were used as the 'gold standard' for diagnosis of {MI.} We measured {ST-segment} elevations in the 12-, 16- and 24-lead postadmission {ECGs} as well as in the 12-, 19- and 24-lead admission {ECGs.}, {RESULTS:} The sensitivity for detecting acute {MI} was 28\% for the postadmission 12-lead {ECG}, 33\% for the 16-lead {ECG} and 37\% for the 24-lead {ECG.} The specificities were 97\%, 93\% and 95\%, respectively. For admission {ECGs}, the sensitivity was 33\% for the 12-lead {ECG}, 45\% for the 19-lead {ECG} and 49\% for the 24-lead {ECG}, with specificities of 97\%, 96\% and 94\%, respectively., {CONCLUSIONS:} The sensitivity for detecting acute {MI} was higher for the 16-, 19- and 24-lead {ECGs} than for the conventional 12-lead {ECGs.} Their specificity, however, was slightly lower. If increased sensitivity for detecting {MI} is desired, the 24-lead or 19-lead should be used as no additional electrodes are required.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} This study was planned to assess strain and strain rate properties of right ventricle in patients with {RV} myocardial infarction., {MATERIAL} {AND} {METHOD:} Thirty patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction were included in this study. The presence of right ventricular infarction in association with an inferior myocardial infarction was defined by an {ST-segment} elevation 0.1 {mV} in lead V4 R. According to this definition, 15 patients had electrocardiographic signs of inferior myocardial infarction without right ventricular infarction (group I), and 15 patients had electrocardiographic signs of inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular infarction (group {II).} Echocardiography was performed using a Vivid 5 System ({GE} Ultrasound; Horten, Norway) and a 2.5-{MHz} transducer. 2-dimensional color doppler myocardial imaging ({CDMI)} data for longitudinal function were recorded from the {RV} free wall using standard apical view. Offline analysis of the myocardial color Doppler data for regional velocity (V), strain rate (Sr), and strain (S) curves was performed using a special software program ({EchoPac} 6.4 Vingmed, Horten, Norway). They were assessed in basal, middle and apical segments of the {RV.} The differences between different groups were assessed with the Mann-Whitney U-test. A value of P {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant., {RESULTS:} Systolic tissue velocity, strain, strain rate of basal (4.8 +/- 0.8 cm/s vs 6.5 +/- 1.2 cm/s, -12 +/- 3\% vs -24 +/- 5\%, 1.28 +/- 0.3/s vs -1.9 +/- 0.4/s; P {\textless} 0.001, {\textless}0.001, {\textless}0.001, respectively) and mid (4.2 +/- 0.5 cm/s vs 5.4 +/- 0.5 cm/s, -16 +/-3\% vs -26 +/- 4\%, -1.2 +/- 0.3/s vs -2.1 +/- 0.3/s; P {\textless} 0.001, {\textless}0.001, {\textless}0.001, respectively) segments of right ventricle were significantly lower in patients with {RV} infarction than in patients without {RV} infarction. There were no differences between groups for apical strain, strain rate, and systolic tissue velocity., {CONCLUSION:} This study demonstrates that right ventricular strain and strain rate were lower in patients with left ventricular inferior wall myocardial infarction with, compared to without, right ventricular infarction.},

In the absence of perfusion defects motion and thickening abnormalities were assessed. Sixty-eight patients with chest pain at rest and either {ST} depression {\textgreater}=0.1 {mV} in {\textgreater}=1 of leads I, {aVL}, V1-V6 on 12-lead {ECG} or {ST} elevation {\textgreater}=0.05 {mV} in {\textgreater}=1 posterior lead on the body surface map comprised the study population. A rest gated perfusion scan was performed within 24 h of symptoms. Scans were scored for perfusion, motion and thickening semi-quantitatively. The scores were compared to the automated {HI.} A 12 h Troponin T {\textgreater}0.09 ng/ml indicated myocardial infarction ({MI).} Sixty-five patients (96\%, 65/68) had {MI.} The summed perfusion score correlated well with the {HI} (rho = 0.90, P {\textless} 0.01) and agreement between scorers was good (kappa = 0.77, 95\% {CI} = 0.57-0.94). The summed motion score correlated with the {HI} (rho = -0.61, P {\textless} 0.01) and agreement between scorers was moderate (kappa = 0.65, 95\% {CI} = 0.52-0.79). Summed thickening score correlated with {HI} (rho = -0.67, P {\textless} 0.01) and agreement between scorers was good (kappa = 0.74, 95\% {CI} = 0.64-0.88). Of the 1156 segments assessed (68 x 17), 542 had normal perfusion. Of these normally perfused segments, 113 (21\%, 113/542) had a motion abnormality and 102 (19\%, 102/542) had a thickening abnormality. Three patients with proven myocardial infarction had normal myocardial perfusion ({HI} {\textless}= 5) but exhibited wall motion and thickening abnormalities. In conclusion, assessment of wall motion and thickening in addition to perfusion in acute myocardial perfusion imaging may improve the diagnostic sensitivity for acute {MI.} Of the scores addressing motion and thickening, interobserver agreement was better for the summed thickening score.},

	Abstract = {This study demonstrates transmission of 12-lead electrocardiography ({ECG)} in an ambulance to the cell phone of the attendant emergency medical technician and then to the hospital and to cell phones of off-site cardiologists. The emergency medical technician cell phone receives Extensible Markup Language files generated by a Phillips Extensible Markup Language {ECG} instrument via Wi-Fi-based wireless network and then sends them to an {ECG-processing} server at the hospital over the mobile telephone network. After reducing {ECG} noises and artifacts, the server converts files to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine-based {ECG} reports stored in Picture Archiving and Communication System. These reports are sent to the cell phones of off-site cardiologists. Consequently, on-site Emergency Department physicians and off-site cardiologists can discuss {ECG} reports via Picture Archiving and Communication System on their computers or cell phones to prepare for the most appropriate treatment while the patient is on the way to the hospital. In conclusion, this 12-lead {ECG} transmission e-technology expands the functions of a 12-lead {ECG} instrument and facilitates more efficient prehospital cardiac care.},

	Abstract = {Objective The aim of this study was to determine the effect that the computer interpretation ({CI)} of electrocardiograms ({EKGs)} has on the accuracy of resident (noncardiologist) physicians reading {EKGs.}
Design A randomized, controlled trial was conducted in a laboratory setting from February through June 2001, using a two-period crossover design with matched pairs of subjects randomly assigned to sequencing groups.
Measurements Subjects' interpretive accuracy of discrete, cardiologist-determined {EKG} findings were measured as judged by a board-certified internist.
Results Without the {CI}, subjects interpreted 48.9\% (95\% confidence interval, 45.0\% to 52.8\%) of the findings correctly. With the {CI}, subjects interpreted 55.4\% (51.9\% to 58.9\%) correctly (p {\textless} 0.0001). When the {CIs} that agreed with the gold standard (Correct {CIs)} were not included, 53.1\% (47.7\% to 58.5\%) of the findings were interpreted correctly. When the correct {CI} was included, accuracy increased to 68.1\% (63.2\% to 72.7\%; p {\textless} 0.0001). When computer advice that did not agree with the gold standard (Incorrect {CI)} was not provided to the subjects, 56.7\% (48.5\% to 64.5\%) of findings were interpreted correctly. Accuracy dropped to 48.3\% (40.4\% to 56.4\%) when the incorrect computer advice was provided (p = 0.131). Subjects erroneously agreed with the incorrect {CI} more often when it was presented with the {EKG} 67.7\% (57.2\% to 76.7\%) than when it was not 34.6\% (23.8\% to 47.3\%; p {\textless} 0.0001).
Conclusions Computer decision support systems can generally improve the interpretive accuracy of internal medicine residents in reading {EKGs.} However, subjects were influenced significantly by incorrect advice, which tempers the overall usefulness of computer-generated advice in this and perhaps other areas.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that younger women are more likely to die during and after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction ({MI)} than older women and men of all ages. This may be partly due to incorrect diagnosis or late detection of acute {MI} in younger women. At high specificity levels ({\textgreater}98\%), the sensitivity of the initial {ECG} to detect acute {MI} may be as low as 30\% when using traditional criteria by both physicians and computerized interpretation programs. This study examines if women of different age groups have a similar {ECG} presentation to men during acute inferior {MI} and if the diagnostic accuracies of the initial {ECG} are comparable. We analyzed chest pain {ECGs} from Mayo Clinic and Medical College of Wisconsin, which included 1,339 patients with acute inferior {MI} and 1,169 age-matched controls with noncardiac chest pain. We subdivided all groups by age (below and above 60 years) and compared {ECG} parameters ({ST} elevation, {ST} depression, {QRS} duration, R-wave amplitude, Q-wave duration and amplitude, {QT} interval) between genders. For inferior {MI} patients under age 60, women had lower {ST} elevations at the J point in lead {II} than men (57 +/- 91 {microV} vs. 86 +/- 117 {microV}, P {\textless} .02). This trend was reversed for patients over age 60 (lead a {VF:} 102 +/- 126 {microV} vs. 84+/-117 {microV}, P {\textless} .04; Lead {III:} 130+/-146 {microV} vs. 103+/-131 {microV}, P {\textless} .007). A neural network method was used to identify the most significant group of {ECG} parameters for detecting acute {MI.} An adaptive fuzzy logic method was developed for adapting to the threshold differences among the different gender and age groups. The new algorithm improved the sensitivity of acute inferior {MI} detection by more than 25\% relative to old algorithm, while maintaining the high specificity around 98\% for noncardiac chest pain patients.},

There are no comparison of serial changes on {ECG} and {DE-MRI} measuring infarct size., {AIM:} The general aim of this study was to describe the acute, healing, and chronic phases of the changes in infarct size estimated by the {ECG} and {DE-MRI.} The specific aim was to compare estimates of the Selvester {QRS} scoring system and {DE-MRI} to identify the difference between the extent of left ventricle occupied by infarction in the acute and chronic phases., {METHODS:} In 31 patients (26 men, age 56 +/- 9) with reperfused {ST-elevation} {MI} (11 anterior, 20 inferior), standard 12-lead {ECG} and {DE-MRI} were taken from 1 to 2 days (acute), 1 month (healing), and 6 months (chronic) after the {MI.} Selvester {QRS} scoring was used to estimate the infarct size from the {ECG.}, {RESULTS:} The correlation values between infarct size measured by {DE-MRI} and {QRS} scoring range from 0.33 to 0.43 higher for anterior than inferior infarcts. The infarct size estimated by {QRS} scoring was larger (about 5\% of the left ventricle) than infarct size by {DE-MRI} acute and 1 month, but at 6 months, there was no difference. In about half of the patients, the {QRS} score agreed with {DE-MRI} in change of infarct size from acute to 6 months., {CONCLUSION:} In conclusion, the Selvester {QRS} scoring system is in half of the patients with reperfused first time {MI} in good accordance with {DE-MRI} in identifying a decrease or no change in the extent of left ventricle occupied by infarction in the acute and chronic phases.},

	Abstract = {Background 
Overreading of 12 lead electrocardiograms ({ECGs)} is required to circumvent errors of computerized {ECG} interpretation. The accuracy of the overreading physician's interpretation of {ECGs} that were incorrectly read as atrial fibrillation by a computer algorithm has not been systematically examined. 
Methods 
A total of 2298 {ECGs} with the computerized interpretation of atrial fibrillation from 1085 patients were analyzed by 2 electrophysiologists, who identified 442 {ECGs} (19\%) from 382 patients (35\%) that were incorrectly interpreted as atrial fibrillation. Charts were reviewed to determine the interpretation of the {ECG} by the ordering physician (primary reader) and the overreading cardiologist. 
Results 
Cardiologists as primary readers more often corrected the misinterpreted {ECGs} as compared with internists, emergency physicians, or other specialists (94\% vs 71\%, P \&lt; .001). Surprisingly, interpretations by cardiologists as primary readers were more accurate than the interpretation provided by overreading cardiologists (94\% vs 72\%, P \&lt; .001). 
Conclusion 
Knowledge of an individual patient on whom an {ECG} is ordered may result in a more critical rhythm assessment and might account for the higher accuracy of rhythm interpretation by the cardiologist as compared with the interpretation by the overreading cardiologist who is lacking relevant clinical information.},

The {STDchange(60} min) was defined as the absolute value of the difference between the baseline and 60-minute {STDsum.} Three cutoff values are reported and represent the smallest values in which the positive likelihood ratio ({+LR)} for {AMI} was greater than or equal to 5, 10, and 20, respectively., {RESULTS:} Acute myocardial infarction occurred in 162 (20.7\%) patients. The smallest cutoff value of the {STDsum(baseline)} for {AMI} with a {+LR} equal to or greater than 5, 10, and 20 was 9.6, 12.4, and 14.1 mm, respectively.

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} We report on 5 patients who presented to the emergency department ({ED)} with chest pain, had negative serum troponin levels, and were discharged with a presumed noncardiac diagnosis. Thereafter, retrospective analysis of Holter monitoring data recorded for a clinical trial revealed {ST} events indicative of transient myocardial ischemia that was unrecognized clinically., {STUDY} {AIM:} The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether initial body surface potential maps estimated from optimal ischemia electrode sites estimated body surface potential map ({EBSPM)} showed signs of ischemia in the missed ischemia group that could have prevented misdiagnosis., {METHODS:} This is a secondary analysis of data from a prospective clinical trial in which patients were attached to 2 Holter monitor devices for simultaneous recordings. One Holter device recorded a standard Mason-Likar 12-lead electrocardiogram ({ECG)} and the other recorded a 10-electrode lead set considered optimal for ischemia detection. A body surface potential map was then estimated from the optimal lead set., {RESULTS:} At 1 year, 2 of the 5 patients with missed ischemia died and a third had an acute myocardial infarction ({MI)} (40\% mortality, 60\% death/nonfatal {MI).} In comparison, 1-year mortality was 5.7\% in 159 similar patients treated for unstable angina at the same institution over the same period (P = .037). The initial standard {ECG} showed no abnormalities in 3 patients and showed left ventricular hypertrophy in 1. The fifth patient with a history of recent {MI} had slight {ST} elevation in leads {III} and {aVF} and Q waves that were considered indicative of recent (not acute) {MI.} {EBSPM} data recorded at the time of {ED} presentation matched the standard {ECG} (normal in 3, left ventricular hypertrophy or inconclusive in 2). During transient ischemia, all 5 {EBSPMs} showed areas of ischemia overlapping with standard electrode sites., {CONCLUSION:} Patients evaluated in the {ED} for chest pain are at high risk for death or nonfatal {MI} if they have ischemic events with continuous {ST-segment} monitoring that are unrecognized clinically. In this small cohort with unrecognized ischemia, the initial body surface potential maps estimated from optimal ischemia electrode sites did not improve on 12-lead {ST-segment} monitoring to identify this high-risk group.},

	Abstract = {Acute myocardial infarction ({AMI)} diagnosis in type {II} diabetes ({DM2)} patients is difficult and {ECG} findings are often non-diagnostic or inconclusive. We developed computer algorithms to process standard 12-lead {ECG} input data for quantitative 3-dimensional ({3D)} analysis ({my3KGTM)}, and hypothesized that use of the {my3KGTM's} array of over 100 {3D-based} {AMI} diagnostic markers may improve diagnostic accuracy for {AMI} in {DM2} patients. Methods: We identified 155 consecutive {DM2} patients age {\textgreater}25 yrs with chest discomfort or shortness of breath who were evaluated at an urban emergency department (130 patients (pts)) or the cardiac catheterization laboratory (25 pts) for possible {AMI.} The first digital 12-lead {ECG} for each patient, obtained within 30 min of presentation, was evaluated by (1) 2 blinded expert cardiologists, and (2) {my3KGTM.} In each case, the {ECG} was classified as either likely {AMI} or likely non-{AMI.} {"Gold} standard" was the final clinical diagnosis. Statistical analysis was {McNemar's} test with continuity correction. Results: The 155 {DM2} patients were 50\% male, mean age 56.8 +/- 12.0 yrs; 44 pts had a final clinical diagnosis of {AMI} (17 {ST} Elevation Myocardial Infarctions ({STEMI)}, 27 Non-{ST} Elevation Myocardial Infarctions ({NSTEMI))} and 111 had no {AMI.} Conclusions: Relative to standard {12L} {ECG} read by cardiologists, quantitative {3D} {ECG} analysis showed significant and substantial gains in sensitivity for {AMI} diagnosis in {DM2} patients, without loss in specificity. Sensitivity gains were particularly high in patients exhibiting {NSTEMI}, the most common form of {AMI} in {DM2.}},

	Abstract = {Objectives 
The primary objective of this report was to describe the infrastructures and processes of selected European and North American pre-hospital fibrinolysis ({PHL)} programs. A secondary objective is to report the outcome data of the {PHL} programs surveyed. 
Background 
Despite its benefit in reducing mortality in patients with {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction, {PHL} remained underused in North America. Examination of existing programs may provide insights to help address barriers to the implementation of {PHL.} 
Methods 
The leading investigators of {PHL} research projects/national registries were invited to respond to a survey on the organization and outcomes of their affiliated {PHL} programs. 
Results 
{PHL} was successfully deployed in a wide range of geographic territories (Europe: France, Sweden, Vienna, England, and Wales; North America: Houston, Edmonton, and Nova Scotia) and was delivered by healthcare professionals of varying expertise. In-hospital major adverse outcomes were rare with mortality of 3\% to 6\%, reinfarction of 2\% to 5\%, and stroke of \&lt;2\%. 
Conclusions 
Combining formal protocols for {PHL} for some patients with direct transportation of others to a percutaneous coronary intervention hospital for primary percutaneous coronary intervention would allow for tailored reperfusion therapy for patients with {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction. Insights from a variety of international settings may promote widespread use of {PHL} and increase timely coronary reperfusion worldwide.},

	Abstract = {Currently used electrocardiographic criteria for identifying patients with {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} perform with high specificity but low sensitivity. Our aim was to enhance ischemia-detection ability of conventional {STEMI} criteria based on 12-lead electrocardiogram ({ECG)} by adding new criteria using 3 vessel-specific leads ({VSLs)} derived from 12-lead {ECG.} Study data consisted of 12-lead {ECGs} acquired during 99 ischemic episodes caused by balloon inflation in, respectively, left anterior descending coronary artery ({LAD;} n = 35), right coronary artery ({RCA;} n = 47), and left circumflex coronary artery ({LCx;} n = 17). {ST} deviation was measured at J point in 12 standard leads, and for 3 {VSLs}, its value was derived from 12-lead {ECG} by using 8 independent predictor leads or just a pair of precordial leads combined with a pair of limb leads. Mean values of sensitivity ({SE)} and specificity ({SP)} of ischemia detection achieved with conventional {STEMI} vs {VSL} criteria were then obtained from bootstrap trials. We found that the detection of ischemic state by conventional criteria achieved the mean {SE/SP} of 60\%/96\% in the total set of ischemic episodes, 74\%/97\% in the {LAD} subgroup, 60\%/94\% in the {RCA} subgroup, and 36\%/100\% in the {LCx} subgroup. In comparison, the mean {SE/SP} values of {VSLs} derived from 8 independent leads of 12-lead {ECG} were, at 125-{microV} threshold, 76\%(*)/96\% in the total set, 91\%(*)/97\% in the {LAD} subgroup, 70\%/94\% in the {RCA} subgroup, and 71\%(*)/100\% in the {LCx} subgroup (with asterisk denoting a statistically significant increase). The mean {SE/SP} of {VSLs} derived from some of the 4-predictor lead sets (namely, those including lead V(3)) matched or exceeded values achieved by {VSLs} derived from 8 predictors; for instance, with predictor leads I, {II}, V(3), V(6) derived {VSLs} attained at 125-{microV} threshold the mean {SE/SP} of 80\%(*)/95\% in the total set, 91\%(*)/97\% in the {LAD} subgroup, 74\%/92\% in the {RCA} subgroup, and 71\%(*)/100\% in the {LCx} subgroup. Based on these results, we conclude that, in our data set, 3 {VSLs} derived from the complete standard 12-lead {ECG-and} even from its subsets-can identify acute ischemia better than existing {STEMI} criteria.},

	Abstract = {The use of thrombolytic therapy and out-of-hospital electrocardiogram ({ECG)} acquisition capability has put even greater importance on the diagnostic accuracy of computerized {ECG} interpretation programs. Such programs must have extremely high specificity to minimize the possibility of clinicians treating inappropriate patients; thereby needlessly subjecting the patients to the risk of potentially life-threatening complications of the medication. At the same time, studies have shown that both prehospital personnel and emergency department ({ED)} physicians are aided by automated {ECG} interpretation programs with high sensitivity. These programs assist the attending personnel in rapidly identifying patients with suspected acute coronary thrombosis, which might otherwise have been undetected or not diagnosed until more obvious {ECG} abnormalities were present. In previous studies, clinically correlated databases have been used to develop and test sensitivity and specificity of the acute infarction detection algorithm in the Marquette {12SL} {ECG} interpretation program. One program revision resulted in a marked increase in sensitivity (21--53\%) without loss of specificity (99.5\% to 99\%). More recent studies have shown the sensitivity of the interpretation program to be influenced greatly by infarct location with sensitivity lower in anterior than inferior injury. Further refinement of the acute infarction interpretation criteria along with the methodology and data used are presented. Increased sensitivity without appreciable loss of specificity has been possible for detection of both acute inferior and anterior infarction; however, different methods were used for each location. Consideration of reciprocal or concomitant repolarization changes are found to be more useful for inferior than anterior injury. Methodological approaches are presented as they relate to the compromise between sensitivity and specificity.},

When an analysis algorithm is modified, the corresponding serial comparison program needs to be updated accordingly. The new Philips diagnostic algorithm increased the number of leads in the {ECG} from the traditional 12 leads to 16, making it possible to diagnose right ventricular infarct/injury based on right-sided lead {V4R.} To keep pace with the widespread reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarct, the serial comparison program was revised to recognize the rapid {ECG} changes in patients with {ST-elevation} myocardial infarct following successful reperfusion therapies. The serial comparison program was also enhanced to split "combined" statements in the category of ventricular conduction delay (includes incomplete ventricular conduction delay and bundle-branch blocks) and compare each of the statements separately.

@misc{huang_vectorcardiogram-based_2011,
	Abstract = {Myocardial infarction ({MI)}, generally known as a heart attack, is one of the top leading causes of mortality in the world. In clinical diagnosis, cardiologists generally utilize 12-lead {ECG} system to classify patients into {MI} symptoms: 1. {ST} segment elevation, 2. {ST} segment depression or T wave inversion. However unstable ischemic syndromes have rapidly changing supply versus demand characteristics that is one of the several limitations of 12-lead {ECG} system for {MI} detection. In addition, the {ECG} sensor placements of 12-lead system is not easily donned and doffed for tele-healthcare monitoring at home. Vectorcardiogram ({VCG)} system in clinic is another type of diagnosis plot which represents the magnitude and direction of the electrical potential in the form of a vector loop during cardiac electric activity. The {VCG} system can easily acquire three {ECG} waves from X, Y, Z directions to composite vector signal in space and the {VCG} signals can be transferred to 12-lead {ECG} signal through Dower transformation and vice versa. Hence, this study attempts to develop a {VCG-based} classification system for the detection of Myocardial infarction. In the experiment results, the proposed system can select the proper {ECG} features based on cardiologist's knowledge and proposed principal moments of {QRS} complex. The classification performance of {MI} detection can be reached to 99.89\% of sensitivity, 92.51\% of specificity, 95.35\% of positive predictive value, and 96.96\% overall accuracy with maximum-likelihood classifier ({MLC).}},

	Abstract = {Introduction. Activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory prior to patient arrival at the hospital, based on a prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram ({ECG)}, reduces doorto- balloon time by 10-55 minutes for patients with {STsegment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} In emergency medical services ({EMS)} systems where transmission of the {ECG} to the emergency department ({ED)} is not feasible, the ability of paramedics to accurately read 12-lead {ECGs} is crucial to the success of a prehospital catheterization laboratory activation program. Objective. To determine whether paramedics can accurately diagnose {STEMI} on a prehospital 12-lead {ECG} and decide to activate the cardiac catheterization laboratory appropriately. Methods. Five chest pain scenarios were generated, with standardized prehospital {ECGs} accompanying each: three {STEMI} cases that should result in catheterization laboratory activation and two non-{STEMI} cases that should not. A convenience sample of paramedics in an urban/suburban {EMS} system examined each scenario and {ECG}, and indicated whether the patient had {STEMI} and whether they would activate the catheterization laboratory. A series of demographic and operational questions were also asked of each participant. We report diagnostic statistics, agreement (kappa), and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs).} Results. A convenience sample of 103 of 147 eligible paramedics (70\%) was enrolled. For {STEMI} diagnosis, paramedics' sensitivity was 92.6\% (95\% {CI} 88.9-95.1) and specificity was 85.4\% (79.7-89.8); for catheterization laboratory activation, sensitivity was 88.0\% (83.8-91.3) and specificity was 88.3\% (83.0-92.2). False-positive activation of the catheterization laboratory occurred in 8.1\% (5.4-12.0) of cases. Of the {STEMI} cases, 94.1\% were correctly read as {STEMI}, and 91.0\% had the catheterization laboratory appropriately activated. Of the non-{STEMI} cases, 14.9\% were incorrectly read as {STEMI}, and 12.0\% had the catheterization laboratory inappropriately activated. The paramedics' comfort with calling a "chest pain alert" with no resulting catheterization laboratory activation (the current practice in this system) was not statistically different from their comfort with calling a chest pain alert if that call were to automatically result in catheterization laboratory activation (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusions. Paramedics in an urban/suburban {EMS} system can diagnose {STEMI} and identify appropriate cardiac catheterization laboratory activations with a high degree of accuracy, and an acceptable false-positive rate, when tested using paper-based scenarios.},

	Abstract = {Background . The use of computer interpretations of electrocardiograms ({ECGs)} as an aid to physician interpretations is widespread. Computer misinterpretations are common and negatively affect physician interpretations. Objective . To measure the effect of computer {ECG} misinterpretations on clinical decision making. Design . Quasi-randomized trial. Setting . Resident teaching conferences. Participants . Included 105 internal and emergency medicine residents. Intervention . After a brief case presentation, residents were asked to interpret an {ECG} and choose appropriate management. Residents chose from a concealed stack of handouts; some contained an erroneous computer interpretation of the {ECG} (citing acute ischemia), and some contained no computer interpretation. Measurements . {ECG} interpretations and management decisions by residents whose {ECG} did or did not include an erroneous computer interpretation were compared using chi-square tests. Results . The presence or absence of erroneous computer interpretations of ischemia did not significantly affect residents' {ECG} interpretations (P=0.62). However, the residents whose {ECGs} included erroneous computer interpretations were more likely to recommend revascularization than the residents without (30\% v. 10\%, P= 0.01). Of those residents who read the {ECG} as diagnostic of ischemia, those with the erroneous computer interpretation were more likely to recommend revascularization than those without (54\% v. 25\%, P=0.048). Limitations . A single {ECG} was used. Conclusions . Erroneous computer interpretations of {ECGs} affected residents' clinical decision making in the absence of an effect on the actual interpretation of the {ECG.} Measuring the impact of computer misinterpretations by examining only physician interpretations will underestimate the effect of computer misinterpretations on clinical decision making.},

	Abstract = {Background: This study was planned to assess strain and strain rate properties of right ventricle in patients with {RV} myocardial infarction. Material and Method: Thirty patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction were included in this study. The presence of right ventricular infarction in association with an inferior myocardial infarction was defined by an {ST-segment} elevation 0.1 {mV} in lead V4 R. According to this definition, 15 patients had electrocardiographic signs of inferior myocardial infarction without right ventricular infarction (group I), and 15 patients had electrocardiographic signs of inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular infarction (group {II).} Echocardiography was performed using a Vivid 5 System ({GE} Ultrasound; Horten, Norway) and a 2.5-{MHz} transducer. 2-dimensional color doppler myocardial imaging ({CDMI)} data for longitudinal function were recorded from the {RV} free wall using standard apical view. Offline analysis of the myocardial color Doppler data for regional velocity (V), strain rate (Sr), and strain (S) curves was performed using a special software program ({EchoPac} 6.4 Vingmed, Horten, Norway). They were assessed in basal, middle and apical segments of the {RV.} The differences between different groups were assessed with the Mann-Whitney U-test. A value of P {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Systolic tissue velocity, strain, strain rate of basal (4.8 +/- 0.8 cm/s vs 6.5 +/- 1.2 cm/s, -12 +/- 3\% vs -24 +/- 5\%, 1.28 +/- 0.3/s vs -1.9 +/- 0.4/s; P {\textless} 0.001, {\textless}0.001, {\textless}0.001, respectively) and mid (4.2 +/- 0.5 cm/s vs 5.4 +/- 0.5 cm/s, -16 +/-3\% vs -26 +/- 4\%, -1.2 +/- 0.3/s vs -2.1 +/- 0.3/s; P {\textless} 0.001, {\textless}0.001, {\textless}0.001, respectively) segments of right ventricle were significantly lower in patients with {RV} infarction than in patients without {RV} infarction. There were no differences between groups for apical strain, strain rate, and systolic tissue velocity. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that right ventricular strain and strain rate were lower in patients with left ventricular inferior wall myocardial infarction with, compared to without, right ventricular infarction.},

@article{brailer_impact_1997,
	Abstract = {This research investigated the effect of computer-assisted test interpretation ({CATI)} on physicians' readings of electrocardiograms ({ECGs).} The authors used an experimental method based on direct observations of 22 cardiologists, each reading 80 {ECGs}, for a total of 1,760 (of which 1,745 were used in the study). There were 40 sets of clini cally-matched pairs of {ECGs}, one with {CATI} and one without. Reading time was ob served and interpretation accuracy was measured by criterion-referenced aggregate scoring. To control for potential biases, the findings were subjected to multivariate analyses using ordinary least-squares regressions. The impact of {CATI} on cardiolo gists' readings of {ECGs} is demonstrably beneficial: the main empirical conclusion of this study is that, compared with conventional interpretation, the use of computer- assisted interpretation of {ECGs} cuts physician time by an average of 28\% and signif icantly improves the concordance of the physician's interpretation with the expert benchmark, without increasing the false-positive rate. Moreover, {CATI} is the most ac curate and saves the most time when the {ECGs} have many unambiguous diagnoses. Given that computers alone cannot perform the task of cardiovascular diagnosis, and that cardiologists' {ECG} interpretations are greatly enhanced by ubiquitous {CATI} tech nology, it appears that the best approach is one that combines person and machine. Key words: electrocardiogram interpretation; computer-assisted test interpretation; physician decision making; diagnostic concordance; technology utilization. (Med Decis Making 1997;17:80-86)},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Analysis of {ST} deviations from the 12-lead electrocardiogram allows for estimation of a spatial {ST} injury vector. The goal of the present study was to compare the location and extent of transmural myocardial ischemia evaluated by myocardial perfusion imaging with the direction and magnitude of the {ST} injury vector., {METHODS:} Twelve-lead electrocardiograms were recorded from 75 acute myocardial infarction patients with single-vessel disease and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction ({TIMI)} flow 0/1 (30 left anterior descending [{LAD]}, 28 right coronary artery [{RCA]}, 17 left circumflex artery [{LCX]).} {ST} deviations were measured in the J point in all leads and used to estimate {ST} injury vectors for each patient. Myocardial perfusion imaging was performed to evaluate the extent and location of myocardial ischemia at the time of coronary intervention., {RESULTS:} Ninety-two percent of the patients showed {ST} injury vectors within the expected directional range for the identified anatomic segment of ischemia by myocardial perfusion imaging. {ST} injury vector direction separated {LAD}, {RCA}, and {LCX} occlusion patients; 90\% of the {LAD} patients showed anterior vectors, 82\% of the {RCA} patients showed posteroinferoseptal vectors, and 59\% of the {LCX} patients showed posteroinferolateral vectors. Eight patients did not fulfill the {ST} elevation criteria for {ST} elevation myocardial infarction but showed anterior {ST} depression and prominent {ST} injury vectors in the posterior torso direction. There was a moderate correlation between the extent of ischemia and {ST} injury vector magnitude for the ischemic patients, r = 0.29., {CONCLUSION:} We found strong agreement between the direction of the {ST} injury vector and the location of myocardial ischemia. The {ST} injury vector may be the key to higher diagnostic accuracy for inferobasal transmural ischemia and may help distinguishing between {RCA} and {LCX} occlusions in the acute phase. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We sought to evaluate the feasibility and effect of improving logistics by early infarct diagnosis in the ambulance and immediate triage to a percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI)} center performed by paramedics only without interference of a {physician.In} the On-{TIME} study, 209 patients were included after prehospital infarct diagnosis and triage in the ambulance (ambulance group, n = 209). Infarct diagnosis was made by highly trained paramedics with the help of a computerized electrocardiographic algorithm. The accuracy of diagnosis, time to treatment, left ventricular function, and clinical outcome were compared with the patients who were diagnosed and triaged at a referral non-{PCI} center (referred group, n = 258). Left ventricular function was assessed before discharge using a nuclear {technique.Acute} myocardial infarction was accurately diagnosed in 95\% of patients in the ambulance group, as compared with 99\% in the referred group (P = .01). The percentage of patients in whom pharmacologic pretreatment (heparin, aspirin, tirofiban, or placebo) was initiated in the ambulance within 90 minutes after the onset of symptoms was 59\% in the ambulance group versus 43\% in the referred group (P {\textless} .01). A left ventricular ejection fraction of {\textless}40\% was present in 25\% in the ambulance group, as compared with 38\% in the referred group (P = .013). After multivariate analysis, ambulance triage was independently associated with a left ventricular ejection fraction {\textgreater}40\% and a favorable long-term clinical {outcome.Early}, prehospital infarct diagnosis, triage, and therapy in the ambulance with direct transportation to the nearest {PCI} center, performed by trained paramedics only, is feasible in 95\% of patients. Ambulance triage resulted in earlier diagnosis and initiation of therapy and was independently associated with a better left ventricular function and clinical outcome, as compared with triage and transportation from a referral non-{PCI} center.},

	Abstract = {Background: Methods: Results: Conclusions: Mortality from acute myocardial infarction is influenced by the speed at which reperfusion therapy is delivered. In the {U.K.}, prehospital thrombolysis ({PHT)}, administered by paramedics, has been developed to improve call to needle ({CTN)} times. Recently, it has been shown in randomised trials that mortality can be further reduced by primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PPCI).} This project was developed to assess current {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction practice in a district general hospital and to prepare paramedics for {PPCI.Data} were collected prospectively over a 12-month period for all patients who received thrombolysis for a presumed myocardial infarct. The primary outcome measures for each case were who delivered the thrombolysis, either the paramedic crew or the hospital, and if the patient did not receive {PHT} the reason why not. Secondary outcome measures included the {CTN} time.153 patients received thrombolysis over the time period (99 men, 54 women, mean age 66 $\pm$ 15 years). Of this group, 55 patients received {PHT} (35.9\%) with a median {CTN} time of 36 min (inter-quartile range ({IQR)} 30-42 min). The commonest reason for exclusion from receiving {PHT} was that the patient's history did not fit the eligibility criteria (25\% of {cases).Paramedics} are able to deliver {PHT} promptly and safely. With the focus now on {PPCI}, it is anticipated that not only will paramedics be able to select patients for delivery to a heart attack centre for {PPCI}, they will be selecting many more patients for this treatment than have up to now received {PHT.}},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss and critically analyse pre-hospital management of acute myocardial infarction ({AMI).} It is clear from several large studies that rapid diagnosis and application of thrombolysis reduces morbidity and mortality rates. Strategies that improve time to treatment in the pre-hospital setting are therefore of fundamental importance in the management of this fatal disease. The advantage of 12 lead electrocardiography use by paramedics to diagnose {AMI} and reduce time to treatment is discussed. Moreover, paramedic application of thrombolysis in the pre-hospital environment is examined. Several studies conducted worldwide support the notion that ambulance services can play a role in minimising time to treatment for patients with {AMI.} The contribution of early intervention by paramedics trained in critical care is potentially considerable, particularly in the important chain of survival that is often initiated by pre-hospital intervention.},

The study population of 91 patients was divided into the catheterization laboratory activation by {EMS} and catheterization laboratory activation by the emergency department physician ({ED-MD)} groups, and also by {EMS} and self-transported {groups.The} {EMS} group had shorter median time intervals from hospital door to percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI)} with balloon inflation than those patients who self-transported to the hospital. Also, patients who were treated during the {EMS} activation of the catheterization laboratory phase had shorter median hospital door to {PCI} times than those who were treated during {ED-MD} activation of the catheterization {laboratory.The} time from hospital arrival to {PCI} with balloon inflation was significantly shorter during the period in which {EMS} activated the catheterization laboratory than during the period the laboratory was activated by hospital staff. Thus, paramedics with quality electrocardiogram interpretation training and education can identify patients with acute {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction and properly activate the catheterization laboratory.

Twenty-five patients (16.6\%; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 11\%-23.5\%) had confirmed {STEMI} and 16 (10.6\%) had confirmed non-{STEMI} acute myocardial infarction. Paramedic sensitivity was 0.80 (95\% {CI}, 0.64-0.96); specificity was 0.97 (95\% {CI}, 0.94-1.00) with positive likelihood ratio of 25.2 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.21. Overall accuracy was similar for paramedic and physician reviewers (0.94, 0.93, 0.95). Highly trained paramedics in an urban emergency medical services system can identify patients with {STEMI} as accurately as blinded physician reviewers.},

	Abstract = {{AIMS}

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI)} is the preferred treatment for {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} The distance to primary {PCI} centres and the inherent time delay in delivering primary {PCI}, however, limit widespread use of this treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of pre-hospital diagnosis on time from emergency medical services contact to balloon inflation (system delay) in an unselected cohort of patients with {STEMI} recruited from a large geographical area comprising both urban and rural districts.


{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}

From February 2004 until January 2007, data on pre-hospital timing and transport distance were prospectively recorded. Patients were divided into groups depending on achievement of pre-hospital diagnosis and/or direct referral to a primary {PCI} centre. Seven hundred and fifty-nine consecutive {STEMI} patients were included. In patients with a pre-hospital diagnosis and direct referral, the system delay was 92 vs. 153 min in patients without pre-hospital diagnosis (P {\textless} 0.001). Patients from rural areas were transported a median of 30 km longer than patients from urban areas; however, this prolonged the system delay by only 9 min.


{CONCLUSION}

Pre-hospital electrocardiographic ({ECG)} diagnosis and direct referral for primary {PCI} enables {STEMI} patients living far from a {PCI} centre to achieve a system delay comparable with patients living in close vicinity of a {PCI} centre.},

	Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

We sought to evaluate the accuracy of emergency medical services ({EMS)} activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory ({CCL)} for patients with {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} and its impact on treatment intervals from dispatch to reperfusion.


{METHODS}

We conducted a before-and-after cohort study of patients presenting via {EMS} with prehospital electrocardiogram findings consistent with {STEMI.} Before August 20, 2007, percutaneous coronary intervention was initiated after patient arrival. Afterward, {EMS} providers could activate the {CCL} if the prehospital electrocardiogram automated interpretation indicated {STEMI.} All interval times from {EMS} dispatch to percutaneous coronary intervention were measured via synchronized timepieces.


{RESULTS}

A total of 53 patients, 14 before and 39 after prehospital activation, were included. Emergency medical services {CCL} activation was 79.6\% sensitive (95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 65.2\%-89.3\%) and 99.7\% specific (95\% {CI}, 99.1\%-99.9\%). Mean door-to-hospital electrocardiogram and mean {CCL-to-reperfusion} times were unaffected by the intervention. Prehospital activation of the {CCL} significantly improved mean door-to-balloon ({D2B)} time by 18.2 minutes (95\% {CI}, 7.69-28.71 minutes; P = .0029) and door-to-{CCL} by 14.8 minutes (95\% {CI}, 6.20-23.39 minutes; P = .0024). Improvements in {D2B} were independent of presentation during peak hours (F ratio = 17.02, P {\textless} .0001). There were significant time savings reflected in all {EMS} intervals: 20.7 minutes (95\% {CI}, 9.1-32.3 minutes; P = .0015) in mean dispatch-to-reperfusion time, 22.2 minutes (95\% {CI}, 11.45-32.95 minutes; P = .0003) in mean first medical contact-to-reperfusion time, and 20 minutes (95\% {CI}, 10.95-29.05 minutes; P = .0001) in recognition-to-reperfusion time.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Emergency medical service providers can appropriately activate the {CCL} for patients with {STEMI} before emergency department arrival, significantly reducing mean {D2B} time. Significant reduction is demonstrated throughout {EMS} intervals.},

@article{williams_paramedic_2008,
	Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}

Correct identification of the J-Point and {ST-segment} on an electrocardiograph ({ECG)} is an important clinical skill for paramedics working in acute healthcare settings. The skill of {ECG} analysis and interpretation is known to be challenging to learn and often is a difficult concept to teach.


{OBJECTIVES}

The objective of the study was to determine if undergraduate paramedic students could accurately identify {ECG} {ST-segment} elevation and J-Point location.


{METHODS}

A convenience sample of undergraduate paramedic students (n = 148) was provided with four enlarged {ECGs} ({ECG1-4)} that illustrated different levels, patterns, and characteristics of {ST-segment} elevation. Participants were asked to identify whether {ST-elevation} was present, and if so, height in millimeters (mm) and the correct location of the J-Point.


{RESULTS}

There were significant variations in students' accuracy with both J-Point and {ST-segment} determination. Eleven (10\%) students correctly identified the {ST-segment} being present in all {ECGs.} Also, {ECG} 2 reflected 6 mm of {ST-elevation;} however, only one student correctly identified this. Overall the students were 0.55 mm (95\% {CI} = 0.29-0.81 mm, range = -6.5-5.8 mm) from the J-point on the horizontal and -0.18 mm (95\% {CI} = -0.31-0.04 mm, range = -2.8-2.3 mm) on the vertical axis.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Undergraduate paramedic students recognize {ST-segment} elevation. However, inaccuracies occurred with measurements of {ST-segment} and precise location of J-Points. Errors in {ECG} analysis may reflect weaknesses in teaching this skill. Consideration should be given to the design of an educational program that can reliably improve performance of this skill.},

Twelve-lead electrocardiograms were recorded in ambulances using a {LIFEPAK} 12 monitor/defibrillator (Physio-Control, Inc., Redmond, Washington) and transmitted digitally to an attending cardiologist. If a diagnosis of {ST} elevation myocardial infarction was made, a patient was taken to a regional interventional center for primary percutaneous coronary intervention or to a local hospital. One thousand consecutive digital electrocardiograms and corresponding interpretations from {LIFEPAK} 12 were available, and these were subsequently interpreted by the University of Glasgow program.

	Abstract = {Background Acute coronary syndromes remain a leading cause of preventable early deaths. However, previous studies have indicated that paramedics' compliance with chest pain protocols is suboptimal and that many patients do not receive the benefits of appropriate prehospital {treatment.Aims} To evaluate paramedics' level of compliance with national clinical practice guidelines and to investigate why, in certain circumstances, they may deviate from the clinical {guidelines.Setting} The Health Service Executive Mid-Western Regional Ambulance Service which serves a mixed urban and rural population across three counties in the west of {Ireland.Method} A retrospective review of completed ambulance Patient Care Report Forms was conducted for all adult patients with non-traumatic chest pain treated between 1 December 2007 and 31 March 2008. During the same study period, paramedics were asked to complete a prospective questionnaire survey investigating the rationale behind their treatment decisions, their estimation of patient risk and their attitudes towards the clinical practice guidelines and {training.Results} 382 completed Patient Care Report Forms were identified for patients with chest pain, of whom 84.8\% received {ECG} monitoring, 75.9\% were given oxygen, 44.8\% were treated with sublingual glyceryl trinitrate ({GTN)} and 50.8\% were treated with aspirin. Only 20.4\% of patients had a prehospital 12-lead {ECG} recorded. 58 completed questionnaires were returned (response rate 15\%); 64\% of respondents said they had received insufficient training to identify {ECG} {abnormalities.Conclusions} Prehospital treatment with oxygen, aspirin, sublingual {GTN} and {ECG} monitoring remains underused by paramedics, even though only a small number of patients had documented contraindications to their use. The small number of patients who received a prehospital 12-lead {ECG} is a cause of particular concern and suggests that incomplete patient assessment may contribute to undertreatment. Further provision of training and equipment is necessary to enable paramedics to more accurately assess and treat patients with acute coronary syndromes.},

@article{guglin_common_2006,
	Abstract = {Objective
The aim of the study was to determine the frequency and nature of errors in computer electrocardiogram ({ECG)} reading.
Methods
The {ECGs} were collected in the tertiary care {VA} Hospital from both inpatients and outpatients. They were read by the electrocardiograph built-in computer software, and then reread by two cardiologists. Statistical analysis was performed using sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predicted value to analyze the data. An error index was formulated as indicator of diagnostic accuracy.
Results
Out of 2072 {ECGs}, 776 (37.5\%) were normal, and 1296 (62.5\%) were abnormal. In 9.9\% of all {ECGs} and in 15.9\% of abnormal {ECGs} there were significant disagreements between the computer and cardiologists. The errors in diagnosis of arrhythmia, conduction disorders and electronic pacemakers accounted for 178 cases, or 86.4\% of all errors. The rest was represented by misdetection of chamber enlargement (7 cases, 3.4\%), misdiagnosis of ischemia and acute myocardial infarction (16 cases, 7.8\%), and lead misplacement (5 cases, 2.4\%).
Conclusions
The most frequent errors in computer {ECG} interpretation are related to arrhythmias, conduction disorders, and electronic pacemakers. Computer {ECG} diagnosis of life threatening conditions e.g. acute myocardial infarction or high degree {AV} blocks are frequently not accurate (40.7\% and 75.0\% errors, respectively). Improvement in the diagnostic algorithms should focus on these areas. Error index is a convenient and informative tool for evaluation of diagnostic accuracy.},

@article{terkelsen_prehospital_2005,
	Abstract = {In patients with {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction, fast initiation of reperfusion therapy is mandatory. It is well established that prehospital diagnosis results in earlier initiation of fibrinolysis, but there is limited evidence concerning the value of prehospital evaluation in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI).} The present paper proposes various prehospital strategies that may be of relevance in treating the latter patients: (1) a substantial reduction in treatment delay may be achieved by prehospital diagnosis, especially if combined with rerouting of patients directly to interventional hospital; (2) use of telemedicine may allow a widespread implementation of a prehospital diagnostic program; (3) a rerouting strategy may result in prolonged transportation. In this setting, continuous real-time 1-lead {ECG} transmission from ambulance to hospital may allow physicians to support ambulance personnel in the treatment of arrhythmias during transportation; and (4) equipment used for prehospital {ECG} acquisition and transmission has built-in features for continuous {ST-segment} monitoring. It is hypothesized that continuous {ST-segment} monitoring performed in the prehospital phase and during primary {PCI} may provide important prognostic information, with the potential of triaging future pharmacological and interventional treatment at time of {PCI.}},

@article{postma_prehospital_2011,
	Abstract = {Background
We evaluated the effect of prehospital triage ({PHT)} in the ambulance on infarct size and clinical outcome and studied its relationship to the distance of patient's residence to the nearest percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI)} center.
Methods
All consecutive {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction patients who were transported to the Isala klinieken from 1998 to 2008 were registered in a dedicated database. Of these, 2,288 (45\%) were referred via a spoke center and 2.840 (55\%) via {PHT.}
Results
{PHT} patients were more often treated within 3 hours after symptom onset (46.2\% vs 26.8\%, P \&lt; .001), more often had a post-procedural thrombolysis in myocardial infarction ({TIMI)} 3 flow (93.0\% vs 89.7\%, P \&lt; .001) had a smaller infarct size (peak creatine kinase 2,188 $\pm$ 2,187 vs 2,575 $\pm$ 2,259 {IU/L}, P \&lt; .001) and had a lower 1-year mortality (4.9\% vs 7.0\%, P = .002). After multivariate analysis, {PHT} was independently associated with ischemic time less than 3 hours ({OR} 2.45, 95\% {CI} 2.13-2.83), a peak creatine kinase less than the median value ({OR} 1.19, 95\% {CI} 1.04-1.36) and a lower 1-year mortality ({OR} 0.67, 95\% {CI} 0.50-0.91). The observed differences between {PHT} patients and the spoke group were more pronounced in the subgroup of patients living \&gt;38 km from the {PCI} center.
Conclusion
{PHT} in the ambulance is associated with a shorter time to treatment, a smaller infarct size and a more favorable clinical outcome, especially with longer distance from the patient's residence to the nearest {PCI} center. Therefore, {PHT} in the ambulance may reduce the negative effect of living at a longer distance from the {PCI} center.},

	Abstract = {Introduction. Previous literature has documented that prehospital 12-lead electrocardiography ({ECG)} decreases the time to reperfusion in patients with an acute {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} Objective. To compare time to {ECG}, time to angioplasty suite (laboratory), and time to reperfusion in emergency medical services ({EMS)} {STEMI} patients, who received care through three different processes. Methods. The setting was a large suburban community teaching hospital with emergency department ({ED)-initiated} single-page acute myocardial infarction ({AMI)} team activation for {STEMI} patients. The population was {STEMI} patients transported by {EMS} from January 2003 to October 2005. Not all {EMS} agencies had prehospital 12-lead {ECG} capability. Paramedics interpret and verbally report clinical assessment and {ECG} findings via radio. The {AMI} team is activated at the discretion of the emergency physician 1) before patient arrival to the {ED} based on {EMS} assessment, 2) after {ED} evaluation with {EMS} {ECG}, or 3) after {ED} evaluation and {ED} {ECG.} Time intervals were calculated from {ED} arrival. To assess the impact of interventions on performance targets, we also report the proportion of patients who arrived in laboratory within 60 minutes and reperfusion within 90 minutes of arrival. Parametric and nonparametric statistics are used for analysis. Results. During the study period, there were 164 {STEMI} patients transported by {EMS;} mean age was 66.1 years, and 56\% were male. Of these, 93 (56.7\%) had an {EMS} {ECG} and 31 (33\%) had {AMI} team activation before {ED} arrival. Mean time to laboratory for all patients was 49.8 +/- 34.4 minutes and time to reperfusion was 93.2 +/- 34.5 min. Patients with prearrival activation were transported to laboratory sooner (mean, 24.3 vs. 53. 4 minutes; p {\textless} 0.001) and received reperfusion sooner than all other patients (mean, 70.4 vs. 96.3 minutes; p = 0.007). More prearrival activation patients met performance targets to laboratory (96.7\% vs. 73.7\%; p = 0.009) and reperfusion (85.2\% vs. 51.0\%; p = 0.003). There was no difference in time to laboratory or to reperfusion for patients who received {EMS} {ECG} but no prearrival activation compared with those who received {EMS} transport alone. Conclusions. A minority of patients with {EMS} {ECGs} had prearrival {AMI} team activation. {EMS} {ECGs} combined with systems that activate hospital resources, but not {EMS} {ECGs} alone, decrease time to laboratory and reperfusion.},

	Abstract = {Objectives
We sought to study the impact of direct referral to an intervention center after pre-hospital diagnosis of {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} on treatment intervals and outcome.
Background
Primary angioplasty has become the preferred reperfusion strategy in {STEMI.} Ambulance diagnosis and direct referral to an intervention center is an attractive treatment option that has not been studied extensively.
Methods
Consecutive pre-hospital patients with {STEMI}, who were referred to our intervention center for primary angioplasty between 2005 and 2007, were studied. After pre-hospital diagnosis, patients were either directly transported to our center or referred through a nonintervention center. The catheterization laboratory was activated before transport to the intervention center.
Results
Of the 581 patients referred, 454 (78\%) came with direct transport and 127 (22\%) through a nonintervention center. Direct transport was associated with a higher proportion of patients treated within the 90-min time window of the {STEMI} guidelines: 82\% versus 23\% (p \&lt; 0.01). Patients directly transported had a significantly shorter median symptom-to-balloon time of 149 min (Interquartile range: 118 to 197 min) versus 219 min (interquartile range: 178 to 315 min), p \&lt; 0.01, a higher post-procedural Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction ({TIMI)} flow grade 3 rate (92\% vs. 84\%; p = 0.03), and a lower 1-year mortality rate (7\% vs. 13\%; p = 0.03). Direct transport to the intervention center was independently associated with the symptom-to-balloon time, which in turn was an independent predictor of post-procedural {TIMI} flow grade 3, a strong prognosticator of outcome.
Conclusions
After ambulance-based diagnosis of {STEMI}, direct transport to an intervention center with pre-hospital notification of the catheterization laboratory more than triples the proportion of patients treated within the time window of the guidelines. Time to balloon was an independent predictor of post-procedural {TIMI} flow grade 3, which underscores the need to reduce treatment delays.},

	Abstract = {With the advent of thrombolytics, guidelines for {ST-elevated} myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} recognition were presented in terms of an {ST} segment exceeding a particular level (1 or 2 mm) in 2 contiguous leads. However, more than half of prehospital electrocardiograms that exceed these {ST} criteria are from patients not having an acute myocardial infarction. In contrast, expert physicians ({EXMD)} maintain a high specificity (\&gt;95\%) for the recognition of {STEMI.} Likewise, in terms of increasing sensitivity, it has been found that the {EXMD} will classify {STEMI} at lower levels than specified in the guideline. Thus, the {EXMD} uses additional electrocardiogram features to identify patients for appropriate intervention.

Given that {STEMI} can be defined in terms of a pattern that is recognized by the {EXMD} as well as a clinical classification that can be evaluated in terms of clinical outcomes, the development and validation of a computer algorithm for {STEMI} need to include both the art of understanding how the human is detecting {STEMI} as well as the science required to develop quantified criteria based on clinical outcomes.

Evidence is presented that demonstrates that reciprocal depression is a strong indicator of {STEMI} versus other causes of {ST} elevation.},

	Abstract = {Background
Reducing time to reperfusion treatment for patients with {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} improves patient outcomes. Few medical systems consistently meet current benchmarks regarding timely access to treatment. Studies have widely demonstrated that prehospital 12-lead electrocardiography can facilitate early catheterization laboratory activation and is the most effective means of decreasing patients' time to treatment.
Methods
We gathered experts to examine the barriers to implementation of prehospital 12-lead electrocardiographic monitoring and transmission to in-hospital cardiologists in creating seamless {STEMI} care systems ({STEMI-CS)} and propose multidisciplinary approaches to overcoming these barriers.
Results and Conclusions
Physicians, hospital systems, and emergency medical services often lack coordination of care delivery and receive fragmented funding and oversight. Clinical and regulatory guidelines do not emphasize local solutions to achieving clinical benchmarks, do not target incentives at all components of the {STEMI-CS}, and underemphasize risk-based approaches to protecting patient health. Integration of the multiple complex components involved in {STEMI-CS} is essential to improving care delivery.},

	Abstract = {Background
Clinical trials in prehospital electrocardiography have focused primarily on {ST} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} The aims of this study were to determine, in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute coronary syndrome ({ACS)}, the (1) relative frequency of various {ACS} types and (2) sensitivity of conventional {ST-T} criteria for diagnosing ischemia in non-{STEMI} or unstable angina.
Methods
A secondary analysis was conducted using data from prospective trials involving 12-lead {ST} monitoring.
Results
Of 968 patients with {ACS}, 120 (12\%) were {STEMI}, 289 (30\%) were non-{STEMI}, and 559 (58\%) were unstable angina. Conventional electrocardiogram ({ECG)} criteria were insensitive (sensitivity, 20\%) for detecting ischemia in patients with non-{STEMI} or unstable angina. There was no ischemia on the initial {ECG} in 85 patients who had subsequent events with {ST} monitoring.
Conclusion
Non-{STEMI} and unstable angina are the most prevalent types of {ACS.} The initial {ECG} is insensitive for detecting ischemia in this population. Transient myocardial ischemia detected with {ST} monitoring commonly occurs in patients without ischemia on the initial {ECG.} {ST} monitoring should be considered in designing prehospital {ECG} systems.},

	Abstract = {{Aims/Methods}
We studied 620 patients who activated ``911'' for chest pain symptoms to determine the sensitivity and specificity of 12-lead electrocardiogram ({ECG)} {ST-segment} monitoring in the prehospital period ({PH} {ECG)} for diagnosing acute coronary syndrome ({ACS)} and to assess whether the addition of {PH} {ECG} signs of ischemia/injury to the initial hospital 12-lead {ECG} obtained in the emergency department would improve the diagnosis of {ACS.}
Results
The sensitivity and specificity of the {PH} {ECG} were 65.4\% and 66.4\%. There was a significant increase in sensitivity (79.9\%) and decrease in specificity (61.2\%) when considered in conjunction with the initial hospital {ECG} (P \&lt; .001). Those with {PH} {ECG} ischemia/injury were more than 2.5 times likely to have an {ACS} diagnosis than those who had no {PH} {ECG} ischemia/injury (P \&lt; .001).
Conclusions
Prehospital {ECG} data obtained with 12-lead {ST-segment} monitoring provides diagnostic information about {ACS} above and beyond the initial hospital {ECG.}},

	Abstract = {The advent of thrombolytic therapy has increased the desire for an accurate computerized recognition of the {ST} elevation associated with acute myocardial infarction ({AMI).} Quantified electrocardiographic ({ECG)} criteria for {AMI}, described in the literature and in computerized {ECG} criteria packages, have concentrated on only those leads that exhibit {ST} elevation. The accuracy of this lead-specific approach has been maximized by an analysis of the associated {ST-segment} and T wave. Further advancement of the Marquette {12SL} program's ability to classify {ST} elevation due to {AMI} has required the inclusion of those leads that are not elevated. This global approach was developed by modifying the {12SL} program so that it would properly diagnose a small training set of clinically correlated {AMI} {ECGs} that did not meet the lead-specific criteria. Further training, via an evaluation of the false-positive rate, was done with a large clinical database (\&gt;30,000 {ECGs).} Both the new and the old criteria were tested with a separate {ECG} database taken from a total of 296 patients. Of these, 77 had an {AMI} (determined via the hospital discharge diagnosis). The lead-specific criteria resulted in a sensitivity of 21\% and a specificity of 99.5\%. The global approach resulted in over twice the sensitivity (53\%), while continuing to maintain a high rate of specificity (98\%).},

	Abstract = {Objective. To evaluate the effect of computer-assisted interpretation of electrocardiograms ({ECGs)} on diagnostic decision making by primary care physicians. Design. Randomized controlled trial. Setting. Primary care physicians' outpatient clinics in or near the Minneap {olis/St.} Paul metropolitan area. Participants. Forty family physicians and general internists who were members of either of two large consortia of clinics. Intervention. Subjects evaluated ten clinical vignettes accompanied by {ECGs} and reported their diagnostic impressions. The vignettes were based on actual patient visits. Half of the subjects received {ECGs} with computer-generated reports, the other half received the same {ECGs} without reports. Main outcome measures. {ECG} reading time; agreement with the clinical diagnosis; agreement with the computer report; diagnostic confidence. Results. The subjects receiving the reports were more likely to agree with the clinical diagnoses of the original cases, particularly for two vignettes in which the diagnoses were uncommon and were mentioned in the reports. The subjects receiving the reports were also more likely to make diagnoses that were consistent with the reports, even when the reports were erroneous. Those receiving the reports spent, on average, 15 seconds less time looking at each {ECG}, a 25\% decrease. Conclusions. In simulated cases, primary care physicians appear to use computer interpre tations of {ECGs} when available, as shown by enhanced diagnostic accuracy and modestly reduced time spent reading the tracings. However, erroneous reports may mislead physi cians. Since the effects of computerized {ECG} interpretation do not appear to have been uniformly favorable in this mock-clinical setting, it will be important to evaluate the effects of this technology in actual practice. Key words: computer-assisted diagnosis; computer-as sisted decision making; physician decision making; electrocardiogram. (Med Decis Making 1995;15:107-112)},

@article{woollard_limited_2005,
	Abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the potential of a continuous telemetry system linking rural ambulances to a coronary care unit to reduce call to thrombolysis {times.Methods:} This prospective randomised controlled trial recruited patients using the 999 ambulance service in a rural area of the {UK} with signs or symptoms of coronary heart disease. Subjects were assigned to receive either standard paramedic treatment or transmission of 12 lead {ECG}, blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and relevant medical history to a general hospital coronary care unit. Cardiology senior house officers then determined each patient's suitability for pre-hospital thrombolysis time, and transmitted this decision back to the ambulance. This was documented as the potential thrombolysis, although no thrombolytic agents were administered by paramedics. The between groups difference in time to potential thrombolysis (intervention group) and actual thrombolysis (controls) was compared. The proportion of intervention group subjects ultimately receiving thrombolysis in hospital was compared with that recommended for pre-hospital {thrombolysis.Results:} The potential reduction in call to treatment time for telemetry patients recommended for pre-hospital thrombolysis was 55 minutes (p = 0.022). Following hospital admission,21/213 of the telemetry patients were thrombolysed (10\%, 95\% confidence interval ({CI)} 6\% to 15\%). Of these patients, 3/21 received a recommendation for thrombolysis in the ambulance (14\%, 95\% {CI} 3.1\% to 36.3\%). The sensitivity and specificity of the telemetry system in detecting patients requiring thrombolysis was 13.6 and 99.5\% respectively. Errors were made in the pre-hospital treatment recommendations for two {patients.Conclusions:} Continuous telemetry systems may significantly reduce call to treatment times for patients recommended for pre-hospital thrombolysis in a rural setting. However, this benefit must be balanced against the very small proportion of eligible patients identified as suitable for pre-hospital thrombolysis. This limitation may be due to communications problems, the criteria used to identify eligible patients, or the seniority of physicians tasked with making treatment decisions.},

Concerns have been raised that this could increase the risk of death. We aimed to determine whether distance to hospital was associated with mortality in patients with life-threatening {emergencies.Methods:} We undertook an observational cohort study of 10 315 cases transported with a potentially life-threatening condition (excluding cardiac arrests) by four English ambulance services to associated acute hospitals, to determine whether distance to hospital was associated with mortality, after adjustment for age, sex, clinical category and illness {severity.Results:} Straight-line ambulance journey distances ranged from 0 to 58 km with a median of 5 km, and 644 patients died (6.2\%). Increased distance was associated with increased risk of death (odds ratio 1.02 per kilometre; 95\% {CI} 1.01 to 1.03; p{\textless}0.001). This association was not changed by adjustment for confounding by age, sex, clinical category or illness severity. Patients with respiratory emergencies showed the greatest association between distance and {mortality.Conclusion:} Increased journey distance to hospital appears to be associated with increased risk of mortality. Our data suggest that a 10-km increase in straight-line distance is associated with around a 1\% absolute increase in mortality.},

	Abstract = {Study Objective: We sought to evaluate quantitatively the evidence on the diagnostic performance of out-of-hospital {ECG} for the diagnosis of acute cardiac ischemia ({ACI)} and acute myocardial infarction ({AMI)} and the clinical effect of out-of-hospital thrombolysis. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the English-language literature published between 1966 and December 1998 on the diagnostic accuracy of out-of-hospital {ECG} and the clinical effect of out-of-hospital thrombolysis. Both prospective and retrospective studies qualified for the assessment of diagnostic performance. For clinical effect, data from prospective nonrandomized studies were synthesized separately from data from randomized trials. Diagnostic performance was assessed by using estimates of test sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios and was summarized by using summary receiver-operating characteristic curves. Measures of clinical effect included time savings, early ventricular function, early mortality, and long-term survival. Results: Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated in 11 studies with a total of 7,508 patients. Data were available for {ACI} in 5 studies and for {AMI} in 8 studies. For {ACI}, the random-effects pooled sensitivity was 76\% (95\% {CI}, 54\% to 89\%), the specificity was 88\% (95\% {CI}, 67\% to 96\%), and the diagnostic odds ratio was 23 (95\% {CI}, 6.3 to 85). The respective figures for {AMI} were sensitivity of 68\% (95\% {CI}, 59\% to 76\%), specificity of 97\% (95\% {CI}, 89\% to 92\%), and diagnostic odds ratio of 104 (95\% {CI}, 48 to 224). Both in nonrandomized (n=4, total 1,531 patients) and randomized (n=9, total 6,643 patients) studies, out-of-hospital thrombolysis shortened the time from onset of symptoms to thrombolytic treatment by 40 to 60 minutes. Data on short-term ejection fraction were sparse. Hospital mortality was reduced by 16\% (95\% {CI}, 2\% to 27\%) among randomized trials, and a similar estimate of effect was seen in nonrandomized studies. There was no clear effect on long-term mortality, but data were sparse. Conclusion: Out-of-hospital {ECG} has excellent diagnostic performance for {AMI} and very good performance for {ACI.} Out-of-hospital thrombolysis achieves time savings and improves short-term mortality, but the effect on long-term mortality is unknown.

@article{swan_factors_2009,
	Abstract = {Background:
In 2005, Orange County California Emergency Medical Services ({EMS)} initiated a field 12-lead program to minimize time to emergency percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI)} for field-identified acute myocardial infarction ({MI).} As the program matured, ``false-positive'' (defined as no {PCI} or coronary artery occlusion upon {PCI)} field {MI} activations have been identified as a problem for the program.

Objectives:
To identify potentially correctable factors associated with false-positive {EMS} triage to {PCI} centers.

Methods:
This was a retrospective, outcome study of {EMS} 12-lead cases from February 2006 to June 2007. The study system exclusively used cardiac monitor internal interpretation algorithms indicating an acute myocardial infarction as the basis for triage. Indicators and variables were defined prior to the study. Data, including outcome, was from the Orange County {EMS} database, which included copies of 12-lead {ECGs} used for field triage. Negative odds ratios ({OR)} of less than 1.0 for positive {PCI} were the statistical measure of interest.

Results:
Five hundred forty-eight patients were triaged from the field for {PCI.} We excluded 19 cases from the study because of death prior to {PCI}, refusal of {PCI}, and co-morbid illness (sepsis, altered consciousness) that precluded {PCI.} Three hundred ninety-three (74.3\%) patients had {PCI} with significant coronary lesions found. False-positive field triages were associated with underlying cardiac rhythm of sinus tachycardia [{OR} = 0.38 (95\% {CI} 0.23, 0.62)]; atrial fibrillation [{OR} = 0.43 (95\% {CI} = 0.20, 0.94)]; an {ECG} lead not recorded [{OR} = 0.39 (95\% {CI} = 0.20, 0.76)]; poor {ECG} baseline [{OR} = 0.59 (95\% {CI} = 0.25, 1.37)]; One of three brands of monitors used in the field [{OR} = 0.35 (95\% {CI} = 0.21, 0.59)]; and female gender [{OR} = 0.50 (95\% {CI} = 0.34, 0.75)]. Age was not associated with false-positive triage as determined by ordinal regression (p=1.00).

Conclusion:
For the urban-suburban {EMS} field 12-lead program studied, age was not associated with false-positive triage. It was unexpected that female gender was associated with false-positive triage. False-positive triage from the field was associated with poor {ECG} acquisition, underlying rhythms of atrial fibrillation and sinus tachycardia, and one brand of 12-lead monitor.},

	Abstract = {Objective: Heart disease is the major cause of death in Wales. Myocardial infarction accounts for most fatalities either acutely or as a result of late heart failure and unheralded sudden cardiac death. Prompt relief of new coronary occlusions by thrombolytic agents has been shown to reduce significantly both early mortality and subsequent morbidity from acute myocardial infarction. The prehospital delivery of these drugs is feasible, and carries no greater risk than administration in hospital. This study tests the hypothesis that paramedics can identify patients with acute myocardial infarction who are suitable for prehospital thrombolysis, and thus reduce the ``call to needle'' {time.Method:} Paramedics from rural Wales were trained in the acquisition and recognition of 12 lead {ECGs}, and also in the modified indications for thrombolytic therapy as defined by the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee ({JRCALC).} Ninety six consecutive patients, with possible myocardial infarction, were included in the study. The paramedics made an independent decision regarding the eligibility of the patients for thrombolysis before hospital admission, noting the time that they could have administered the drug. These decisions were compared with the treatment subsequently received in {hospital.Results:} No errors were made by the paramedics in case selection (specificity of 100\% (95\% {CI} 95.9\% to 100\%)). There was a potential reduction in call to needle time of 41.2 minutes (95\% {CI} 25.7 minutes to 56.9 minutes, {p=0.001).Conclusions:} It was concluded that the paramedic selection of patients for the prehospital administration of a thrombolytic is both feasible and safe.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Knowledge of the size and location of ischemic myocardium during acute coronary occlusion could provide decision support before reperfusion therapy. Electrocardiogram ({ECG)} scores based on the number of leads and the sum of {ST-segment} elevation have been unreliable in quantifying ischemia. We aimed to develop a new method to graphically display ischemic myocardium from simulated {ECGs} ({DIMS-ECG)} associated with known ischemic regions., {METHODS:} Twenty-one patterns of ischemia based on normal coronary anatomy were programmed into the freely available program {ECGSIM} (www.ecgsim.org). Minor variations of these patterns and 5 levels of ischemia severity produced 45 455 {ECGs;} 1000 normal {ECGs} were also added. Given a de novo {ECG} (an {ECG} from a patient), {ST-segment} and T-wave measurements are compared with {ECG} measurements in the database. The closest 200 matches are selected, and the corresponding ischemic areas are "averaged" to create a graphical display of the ischemic myocardium., {RESULTS:} Three patients are presented who underwent elective coronary angioplasty with continuous {ECG} recording and scintigraphically defined ischemic myocardium. Based on {ECG} analysis, the program graphically displays the ischemic myocardium with close agreement to the scintigraphic images. The program's source code and the {ECG} database will be made freely available., {CONCLUSIONS:} The {DIMS-ECG} method graphically displays ischemic myocardium from information contained in the 12-lead {ECG} based on a novel approach to use a large simulated database instead of rule- or score-based method. After further development and testing, the {DIMS-ECG} method could be used to risk stratify patients with acute myocardial infarction.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Recent studies have proposed to include both {ST} depression and {ST} elevation in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia, hence, considering all {ST} deviations relevant. In this study, we examined to which extent an {ST} dipole model accounts for the measured {ST} deviations in acute ischemia patients using 2 different sets of lead vectors., {METHODS:} 12-Lead electrocardiograms ({ECGs)} were recorded from 45 patients with occlusive single-vessel disease with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction ({TIMI)} flow 0/1 (15 anterior descending artery, 15 right coronary artery, 15 left circumflex artery), and {ST} deviations were measured in the J point in all leads. The dipole model was established by considering {ST} deviations as projections of a single dipole onto a set of lead vectors. A set of simplified unit length lead vectors and a set of lead vectors from the Dower transformation were compared. For each {ECG} and model, the best-fitting dipole was estimated by minimizing the sum of squared errors between measured and projected {ST} deviations across all leads., {RESULTS:} The goodness-of-fit metric (R(2)) for all recordings showed strong agreement between measured and projected {ST} deviations for both dipole models with R(2) of 0.77 to 0.83 (95\% confidence interval [{CI])} for the simplified model and R(2) of 0.91 to 0.93 (95\% {CI)} for the Dower-based model. The Dower-based model showed superior performance for the whole population and for each of the occlusion artery subgroups (P {\textless} .05), but only small differences were seen between the estimated {ST} dipoles from the 2 models., {CONCLUSION:} A simple dipole model may be a useful descriptor of {ST-segment} deviations, reducing {ST} deviation measurements from 12 leads to a single 3-dimensional vector.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The use of two-dimensional echocardiography ({2D} echo) for detection of ischaemia is limited due to high user dependency. Longitudinal motion is sensitive for ischaemia and usable for quantitative measurement of longitudinal myocardial function but time consuming. Velocity tracking ({VeT)} is a new method that gives an easy three-dimensional understanding of both systolic and diastolic regional motion, using colour coded bull's eye presentation of longitudinal velocity, derived from colour coded tissue Doppler. The aim of this study was to test the accuracy of {VeT} in detecting ischaemia in non-{ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({NSTEMI)} patients bedside., {METHODS:} Twenty patients with {NSTEMI} and 10 controls were included. Echocardiography was performed within 24 h of symptoms and prior to coronary angiography. Bull's eye plots presenting the peak systolic velocity ({PSV)} and the sum of {PSV} and the E-wave-velocity ({PSV+E)} were created using our developed software. {VeT} was compared to expert wall motion scoring ({WMS)} and bedside echo. We used the clinical conclusion based on {ECG}, angiography and clinical picture as 'gold standard'., {RESULTS:} Sensitivity for ischaemia with {VeT} ({PSV+E)} was 85\% and specificity 60\%. The corresponding sensitivities for expert {WMS} were 75\% (specificity 40\%). For regional analysis {VeT} and {WMS} showed comparable results with correct regional outcome in 11/20 of patients both superior to bedside echo., {CONCLUSION:} Velocity tracking is a promising technique that provides an easily understandable three-dimensional bull's eye plot for assessment of regional left ventricular longitudinal velocity with great potential for detection of regional dysfunction and myocardial ischaemia.},

	Abstract = {Background 
Prehospital triage of {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} for primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI)} reduces treatment times. Prehospital triage and transport of {STEMI} patients have traditionally been undertaken in emergency medical service systems with Advanced Care Paramedics ({ACPs).} However, {ACPs} are not available in many regions. A pilot study was conducted to determine the feasibility of prehospital {STEMI} triage in a region with only Primary Care Paramedics. 
Methods 
Hemodynamically stable patients with chest pain and suspected {STEMI} were brought directly to a catheterization laboratory for primary {PCI.} End points included accuracy of prehospital {STEMI} identification, complications during transfer, and treatment times. 
Results 
One hundred thirty-four consecutive patients with suspected {STEMI} were triaged for primary {PCI.} Only 1 patient developed complications during transport (rapid atrial flutter) that required {ACP} skills. One hundred thirty-three patients underwent urgent angiography, and 105 patients underwent {PCI.} Based on physician interpretation of the prehospital electrocardiogram, there was agreement with triage decision for 121 (90\%) of the 134 cases. The final diagnosis based on the angiogram and cardiac markers was true {STEMI} for 106 patients and false positive for 28 patients. The median first medical contact to balloon time was 91 (81-115) minutes. 
Conclusions 
Hemodynamically stable patients with suspected {STEMI} can be safely and effectively transported directly for primary {PCI} by paramedics without advanced care training. Prehospital {STEMI} triage for primary {PCI} can be extended to regions that have few or no paramedics with advanced care training.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Left ventricular hypertrophy ({LVH)} predisposes to larger infarct size, which may be underestimated by the left ventricular ejection fraction ({LVEF)} due to supranormal systolic performance often present in patients with {LVH.} The aim of the study was to compare infarct size and {LVEF} in patients with {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} and increased left ventricular mass on cardiac magnetic resonance ({CMR).}, {METHODS:} The study included unselected group of 52 patients (61+/-11 years, 69\% male) with first {STEMI} who had {CMR} after median 5 days from the onset of the event. Left ventricular hypertrophy ({LVH)} was defined as left ventricular mass index exceeding 95th percentile of references values for age and gender. Infarct size was assessed with means of late gadolinium enhancement ({LGE).}, {RESULTS:} {LVH} was found in 16 patients (31\%). In comparison to the rest of the group, patients with {LVH} had higher absolute and relative infarct mass (p=0.002 and p=0.02, respectively). {LVH} was related to higher prevalence of microvascular obstruction and myocardial haemorrhage and higher number of {LV} segments with transmural necrosis (p=0.02, p=0.01 and p=0.01, respectively). Despite marked difference in the infarct size between both studied subgroups there was no difference in {LVEF} and mean number of dysfunctional {LV} segments., {CONCLUSIONS:} Patients with {LVH} undergoing {STEMI} have larger infarct size underestimated by the {LV} systolic performance in comparison to patients without {LVH.} Copyright Copyright 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Analysis of {ST-segment} elevation for assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary occlusion is in widespread use for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. In this study, changes in the {QRS} complex also were analyzed to determine if these changes that are seldom used clinically can provide additional prognostic information. An acute coronary occlusion canine model, in which direct measurements of myocardial salvage were made, was used to assess whether {ST-segment} and {QRS} complex changes during coronary occlusion yielded independent estimates of the amount of salvage provided by reperfusion with arterial blood., {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS:} Continuous electrocardiographic recordings were obtained from 14 study dogs undergoing a 90-minute period of coronary artery occlusion in which the severity of the ischemia during the occlusion was estimated at 10 and 45 minutes by microsphere injections. After 3 hours of reperfusion, the myocardium at risk and postmortem infarct size was measured. Myocardial salvage correlated inversely with both {ST-segment} elevation (r = -0.85; P {\textless} .0001), and {QRS} complex prolongation (r = -0.72; P = .003). When dogs were paired so that they had equal amounts of {ST} elevation but differed with respect to the presence of {QRS} prolongation, less myocardial salvage was found in those with {QRS} prolongation. The independent value of {QRS} prolongation was supported further by the observation that presence of {QRS} prolongation resulted in a loss of the highly significant correlation between {ST} elevation and salvage (r = -0.60; P = .2)., {CONCLUSIONS:} High magnitudes of {ST} elevation are correlated significantly with less myocardial salvage. Moreover, for a given magnitude of {ST} elevation, the presence of concurrent {QRS} prolongation is associated with even less myocardial salvage.},

@misc{syed_spectral_2009,
	Abstract = {Unstable conduction system bifurcations following ischemia and infarction are associated with variations in the electrocardiographic activity spanning the heart beat. In this paper, we investigate a spectral energy measure of morphologic differences ({SE-MD)} that quantifies aspects of these changes. Our measure uses a dynamic time-warping approach to compute the time-aligned morphology differences between pairs of successive sinus beats in an electrocardiographic signal. While comparing beats, the entire heart beat signal is analyzed in order to capture changes affecting both depolarization and repolarization. We show that variations in electrocardiographic activity associated with death can be distinguished by their spectral characteristics. We developed the {SE-MD} metric on holter data from 764 patients from the {TIMI} {DISPERSE2} dataset and tested it on 600 patients from the {TIMI} {MERLIN} dataset. In the test population, high {SE-MD} was strongly associated with death over a 90 day period following non-{ST-elevation} acute coronary syndrome ({HR} 10.45, p {\textless} 0.001) and showed significant discriminative ability (c-statistic 0.85). In comparison with heart rate variability and deceleration capacity, {SE-MD} was also the most significant predictor of death in the study population. Furthermore, {SE-MD} had low correlation with these other measures, suggesting that complementary use of the risk variables may allow for more complete assessment of cardiac health.},

	Abstract = {Objective: The magnitude of {ST} elevation is a key piece of information in the decision to thrombolyse in acute myocardial infarction. The ability of clinicians to reliably identify {ST} elevation has not been previously assessed. This study sought to determine the variability in assessment of {ST} elevation in a group of doctors who commonly prescribe thrombolysis.
Methods: The study was conducted in three large teaching hospitals in Manchester, England. A convenience sample of 63 {SHOs} and {SpRs} from emergency and general medicine were recruited. Each was shown three sample {ECG} complexes. They were asked to identify and quantify the degree of {ST} elevation. They then indicated the points on the {ECG} from which they measured {ST} elevation.
Results: {ST} elevation was not identified in 12\% of cases. Doctors used a wide variety of points on the {ST} segment to assess elevation, this resulted in a wide variation in the observed magnitude of {ST} elevation.
Conclusion: No guidance exists on where exactly {ST} elevation should be measured. This study shows a wide variation in practice. Protocol led thrombolysis decision pathways may be compromised by these findings.},

Currently, up to one-third of eligible {STEMI} patients in industrialized countries worldwide receive no specific reperfusion treatment, a problem that is rectified by the development and implementation of {STEMI} networks, as also recommended by the latest European Society of Cardiology and American College of {Cardiology/American} Heart Association guidelines. Indeed, over the last 5 years, published figures demonstrate that {STEMI} networks increase the percentage of patients treated by any reperfusion strategy, and the percentage of patients receiving treatment within the recommended time frames has also improved, thereby reducing in-hospital and long-term mortality to very low levels. This manuscript demonstrates how {STEMI} networks can be adapted to local needs and circumstances against pre-existing barriers and despite the heterogeneity in local situations, patient's characteristics, treatment delays, and distances for transfer. Modern and efficacious networks must be prepared to offer both primary percutaneous coronary intervention and thrombolytic therapy, preferably prehospital, as long as primary percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be guaranteed to all individuals within the recommended timeline.},

@article{fosbol_prehospital_2013,
	Abstract = {Background 
Emergency medical services ({EMS)} are critical in the treatment of {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} Prehospital system delays are an important target for improving timely {STEMI} care, yet few limited data are available. 
Methods 
Using a deterministic approach, we merged {EMS} data from the North Carolina Pre-hospital Medical Information System ({PreMIS)} with data from the Reperfusion of Acute Myocardial Infarction in Carolina Emergency {Departments---Emergency} Response ({RACE-ER)} Project. Our sample included all patients with {STEMI} from June 2008 to October 2010 who arrived by {EMS} and who had primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI).} Prehospital system delays were compared using both {RACE-ER} and {PreMIS} to examine agreement between the 2 data sources. 
Results 
Overall, 8,680 patients with {STEMI} in {RACE-ER} arrived at a {PCI} hospital by {EMS;} 21 {RACE-ER} hospitals and 178 corresponding {EMS} agencies across the state were represented. Of these, 6,010 (69\%) patients were successfully linked with {PreMIS.} Linked and notlinked patients were similar. Overall, 2,696 patients were treated with {PCI} only and were taken directly to a {PCI-capable} hospital by {EMS;} 1,750 were transferred from a non-{PCI} facility. For those being transported directly to a {PCI} center, 53\% reached the 90-minute target guideline goal. For those transferred from a non-{PCI} facility, 24\% reached the 120-minute target goal for primary {PCI.} 
Conclusions 
We successfully linked prehospital {EMS} data with inhospital clinical data. With this linked {STEMI} cohort, less than half of patients reach goals set by guidelines. Such a data source could be used for future research and quality improvement interventions.},

@article{skorning_teleconsultation_2012,
	Abstract = {Background 
Teleconsultation from the scene of an emergency to an experienced physician including real-time transmission of monitoring, audio and visual information seems to be feasible. 
 
In preparation for bringing such a system into practice within the research project {``Med-on-@ix''}, a simulation study has been conducted to investigate whether telemedical assistance ({TMA)} in Emergency Medical Services ({EMS)} has an impact on compatibility to guidelines and timing. 
Material and methods 
In a controlled simulation study 29 {EMS} teams (one {EMS} physician, two paramedics) ran through standardized scenarios ({STEMI:} {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction; {MT:} major trauma) on high-fidelity patient simulators with defined complications (treatable clearly following guidelines). Team assignments were randomized and each team had to complete one scenario with and another without {TMA.} Analysis was based on videotaped scenarios using pre-defined scoring items and measured time intervals for each scenario. 
Results 
Adherence to treatment algorithms improved using {TMA.} {STEMI:} cathlab informed (9/14 vs. 15/15; p = 0.0169); allergies checked prior to acetylsalicylic acid (5/14 vs. 13/15; p = 0.0078); analgosedation prior to cardioversion (10/14 vs. 15/15; p = 0.0421); synchronized shock (6/14 vs. 14/15; p = 0.0052). {MT:} adequate medication for intubation (3/15 vs. 10/14; p = 0.0092); mean time to inform trauma centre 547 vs. 189 s (p = 0.0001). No significant impairment of performance was detected in {TMA} groups. 
Conclusions 
In simulated setting {TMA} was able to improve treatment and safety without decline in timing. Nevertheless, further research is necessary to optimize the system for medical, organizational and technical reasons prior to the evaluation of this system in routine {EMS.}},

@article{vermeulen_prehospital_2008,
	Abstract = {Background
Primary coronary intervention ({PCI)} for acute myocardial infarction should be performed as quickly as possible, with a door-toballoon time of less then 90 minutes. However, in daily practice this cannot always be achieved. Prehospital diagnosis of {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} is of major importance in reducing time to treatment, in particular when patients can be transported directly to a centre with interventional capacities.

Objectives
The aim of the current study was to evaluate the time from prehospital diagnosis of {STEMI} to balloon inflation and identify factors related to treatment delay in patients directly referred to the catheterisation laboratory of the University Medical Centre of Groningen.

Methods
A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to collect data on patients treated with primary {PCI} after prehospital diagnosis of {STEMI.}

Results
Median prehospital diagnosis-to-balloon time was 64 minutes for patients directly admitted to the catheterisation laboratory and 75 minutes for patients initially admitted to the coronary care unit. A delay longer than 90 minutes was observed in 18 patients. Higher age was associated with longer delay times (p=0.041). Long delays were not associated with diabetes (p=0.293), time from symptom onset to prehospital diagnosis (p=0.87) or time of day (p=0.09). Initial unavailability of the catheterisation laboratory due to running procedures contributed to longer delay times in ten cases.

Conclusion
Prehospital diagnosis of {STEMI} and direct referral to a catheterisation laboratory for primary {PCI} allows a prehospital diagnosis-toballoon time of less than 90 minutes in 82\% of patients. Older patients are at risk of longer delays. (Neth Heart J 2008;16:5-9.18317537)},

@article{sillesen_referral_2008,
	Abstract = {Background 
Time from symptom onset to reperfusion is essential in patients with {ST-segment} elevation acute myocardial infarction. Prior studies have indicated that prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram ({ECG)} transmission can reduce time to reperfusion. 
Purpose 
Determine 12-lead {ECG} transmission success rates, and time saved by referring patients directly to primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({pPCI)} bypassing local hospitals and emergency departments. 
Methods 
Prehospital 12-lead {ECG} was recorded in patients with symptoms suggesting acute coronary syndrome during a 1-year pilot phase and transmitted to the attending cardiologist's mobile phone. Transmission success rates were determined, and prehospital and hospital delays were recorded and compared to historic controls. 
Results 
Transmission was attempted in 152 patients and was successful in 89\%. Twenty-seven patients were referred directly for {pPCI.} Median hospital arrival to {pPCI} was 22 vs 94 minutes in the control group (P \&lt; .01). 
Conclusions 
Transmission of prehospital {ECG} is technically feasible and reduces time to {pPCI} in {ST-segment} elevation acute myocardial infarction patients.},

@article{peterson_systematic_2012,
	Abstract = {Background 
Door to balloon time is important in the outcome of {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous intervention. This review summarizes prognostic factors for door to balloon time in {STEMI} patients presenting to a {PCI} capable hospital. 
Method 
{NLM} Gateway and Cochrane {CENTRAL} are the primary data sources. Searched reports were screened by title and abstract and full texts were located for potentially relevant articles. References from the selected articles and relevant background papers were hand searched for additional reports. Articles were reviewed and assessed for risk of bias. The results are summarized without meta-analysis. 
Results 
90 papers are included in the review. Individual study quality was variable but was generally low. A number of patient characteristics, hospital characteristics, physician characteristics, care processes and ``other'' factors were associated with door to balloon time. Prognostic factors for longer times include: pre-hospital delay in presentation, cerebrovascular disease, absence of chest pain, lower {PCI} volume and specialization hospital, lower sum {ST} elevation, absence of Q waves and left bundle branch block. Shorter times were associated with: presentation during regular hours, {PCI} in a more recent year, 24 hour on site cardiology, pre-hospital {ECG}, single call to central page to activate the catheterization lab, {ER} physician activating the cath lab, lab staff arriving within 20 min of paging and culprit vessel {PCI} before full diagnostic angiography. 
Conclusion 
Understanding prognostic factors for door to balloon time can likely lead to improved quality of care for {STEMI.}},

@article{smith_diagnosis_2012,
	Abstract = {Study objective 
Sgarbossa's rule, proposed for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block, has had suboptimal diagnostic utility. We hypothesize that a revised rule, in which the third Sgarbossa component (excessively discordant {ST-segment} elevation as defined by ≥5 mm of {ST-segment} elevation in the setting of a negative {QRS)} is replaced by one defined proportionally by {ST-segment} elevation to S-wave depth ({ST/S} ratio), will have better diagnostic utility for {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} equivalent, using documented coronary occlusion on angiography as reference standard. 
Methods 
We collected admission {ECGs} for all patients with an acutely occluded coronary artery and left bundle branch block at 3 institutions. The {ECGs} of emergency department patients with chest pain or dyspnea and left bundle branch block, but without coronary occlusion, were used as controls. The R or S wave, whichever was most prominent, and {ST} segments, relative to the {PR} segment, were measured to the nearest 0.5 mm. The {ST/S} ratio was calculated for each lead that has both discordant {ST} deviation of greater than or equal to 1 mm and an R or S wave of opposite polarity; others were set to 0. The cut point for the most negative {ST/S} ratio with at least 90\% specificity was determined. The revised rule is unweighted, requiring just 1 of 3 criteria. Diagnostic utilities of the original and revised Sgarbossa rules were computed and compared. {McNemar's} test was used to compare sensitivities and specificities. 
Results 
The study and control groups included 33 and 129 {ECGs}, respectively. The cut point selected for relative discordant {ST-segment} elevation was −0.25. Excessive absolute discordant {ST-segment} elevation of 5 mm was present in at least one lead in 30\% of {ECGs} in patients with confirmed coronary occlusion versus 9\% of the control group, whereas excessive relative discordant {ST-segment} elevation less than −0.25 was present in 58\% versus 8\%. Sensitivity of the revised rule in which {ST-segment} elevation with an {ST/S} ratio less than or equal to −0.25 replaces {ST-segment} elevation greater than or equal to 5 mm was significantly greater than either the weighted (P\&lt;.001) or unweighted (P=.008) Sgarbossa rule: 91\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI]} 76\% to 98\%) versus 52\% (95\% {CI} 34\% to 69\%) versus 67\% (95\% {CI} 48\% to 82\%). Specificity of the revised rule was lower than that of the weighted rule (P=.002) and similar to that of the unweighted rule (P=1.0): 90\% (95\% {CI} 83\% to 95\%) versus 98\% (95\% {CI} 93\% to 100\%) versus 90\% (95\% {CI} 83\% to 95\%). Positive and negative likelihood ratios for the revised rule were 9.0 (95\% {CI} 8.0 to 10) and 0.1 (95\% {CI} 0.03 to 0.3). The revised rule was significantly more accurate than both the weighted (16\% difference; 95\% {CI} 5\% to 27\%) and unweighted (12\% difference; 95\% {CI} 2\% to 22\%) Sgarbossa rules. 
Conclusion 
Replacement of the absolute {ST-elevation} measurement of greater than or equal to 5 mm in the third component of the Sgarbossa rule with an {ST/S} ratio less than −0.25 greatly improves diagnostic utility of the rule for {STEMI.} An unweighted rule using this criterion resulted in excellent prediction for acute coronary occlusion.},

	Abstract = {Objective To evaluate the consequence of treatment delay of primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PPCI)} on long-term survival.
Background Network organisation based on early recognition, shortening prehospital time delays and procedural delays is the cornerstone of optimal clinical results in the acute phase of {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} Nevertheless, the evidence of a relationship between symptom onset-to-balloon time and mortality is weak, and few long-term data are available.
Setting and measures In this single-centre observational follow-up study, we evaluated the long-term survival of 790 consecutive {STEMI} patients (mean age 68$\pm$13 years; 73\% males) undergoing {PPCI≤12} h from symptom onset, or 12--36 h in the case of persistence of symptoms or hemodynamic instability.
Results The median ({IQR)} treatment delay, defined as the time from symptom onset to reperfusion, was 180 min (120;310), fairly balanced between patient delay (80 min (40;140)) and system delay (80 min (60--114)). Patients with a treatment delay {\textless}180 min displayed lower mortality at 1, 3, 5 and 7 years (12\%, 17\%, 22\% and 26\%, respectively) than those with a treatment delay {\textgreater}180 min (15\%, 24\%, 28\% and 37\%, respectively). The {HR} was 0.7 (95\% {CI} 0.5 to 0.9). On univariate and stepwise multiple regression analysis, field triage and transportation (p=0.0001), shorter distance from hospital (p=0.02) and male gender (p=0.02), but not clinical variables, were independent predictors of shorter treatment delay.
Conclusions Shorter symptom onset-to-balloon time predicts long-term lower mortality in {STEMI} patients treated with {PPCI.} Our findings emphasise the need to minimise any component of treatment delay.},

	Abstract = {{Background---National} guidelines call for participation in systems to rapidly diagnose and treat {ST-segment--elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} In order to characterize currently implemented {STEMI} reperfusion systems and identify practices common to system organization, the American Heart Association surveyed existing systems throughout the United States.
Methods and {Results---A} {STEMI} system was defined as an integrated group of separate entities focused on reperfusion therapy for {STEMI} within a geographic region that included at least 1 hospital that performs percutaneous coronary intervention and at least 1 emergency medical service agency. Systems meeting this definition were invited to participate in a survey of 42 questions based on expert panel opinion and knowledge of existing systems. Data were collected through the American Heart Association Mission: Lifeline website. Between April 2008 and January 2010, 381 unique systems involving 899 percutaneous coronary intervention hospitals in 47 states responded to the survey, of which 255 systems (67\%) involved urban regions. The predominant funding sources for {STEMI} systems were percutaneous coronary intervention hospitals (n = 320, 84\%) and /or cardiology practices (n = 88, 23\%). Predominant system characteristics identified by the survey included: {STEMI} patient acceptance at percutaneous coronary intervention hospital regardless of bed availability (N = 346, 97\%); single phone call activation of catheterization laboratory (N = 335, 92\%); emergency department physician activation of laboratory without cardiology consultation (N = 318, 87\%); data registry participation (N = 311, 84\%); and prehospital activation of the laboratory through emergency department notification without cardiology notification (N = 297, 78\%). The most common barriers to system implementation were hospital (n = 139, 37\%) and cardiology group competition (n = 81, 21\%) and emergency medical services transport and finances (n = 99, 26\%).
{Conclusions---This} survey broadly describes the organizational characteristics of collaborative efforts by hospitals and emergency medical services to provide timely reperfusion in the United States. These findings serve as a benchmark for existing systems and should help guide healthcare teams in the process of organizing care for patients with {STEMI.}},

	Abstract = {The electrocardiographic ({ECG)} diagnosis of {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} represents a challenge to all health care providers, particularly so for the novice {ECG} interpreter. We have developed---and present in this article---a 4-step algorithm that will detect {STEMI} in most instances in the prehospital and other nonemergency department ({ED)} settings. The algorithm should be used in adult patients with chest pain or equivalent presentation who are suspected of {STEMI.} It inquires as to the presence of {ST-segment} elevation as well as the presence of {STEMI} confounding/mimicking patterns; the algorithm also makes use of reciprocal {ST-segment} depression as an adjunct in the {ECG} diagnosis of {STEMI.} If {STEMI} is detected by this algorithm, then management decisions can be made based upon this {ECG} diagnosis. If {STEMI} is not detected using this algorithm, then we can only note that {STEMI} is not ``ruled in''; importantly, {STEMI} is not ``ruled out.'' In fact, more expert interpretation of the {ECG} will be possible once the patient (and/or the {ECG)} arrive in the {ED} where {ECG} review can be made with the more complex interpretation used by expert physician interpreters.},

@article{majumder_superior_2012,
	Abstract = {Aims 
Admitting patients directly to a heart attack center ({HAC)} catheter laboratory for primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PPCI)} bypassing the emergency department ({ED)} might be beneficial in delivering treatment of {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction with superior outcome. 
Methods 
In this analysis, the clinical outcome of service redesign of the {PPCI} pathway from {ED} triggered to a direct catheter laboratory {HAC} access was assessed in 361 consecutive patients with {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction treated with a {PPCI.} 
Results 
A total of 200 patients were admitted via the {ED}, and 161 were admitted directly to the {HAC.} Door-to-balloon times and call-to-balloon times were significantly better in the {HAC} group (median [interquartile range] door-to-balloon times and call-to-balloon times were 39 [26, 53] and 106 [91, 132] minutes, respectively) in comparison with the {ED} group (82 [49,120; P \&lt; .0001] and 130 [103, 164] minutes, respectively [P = .0005]). A nonsignificant trend to a lower 30-day (5\% in the {HAC} group and 6\% in the {ED} group) and 17-month (8\% in {HAC} group and 11\% in {ED} group) mortality was seen in the {HAC} group (P = .63). Composite end point analysis of left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50\%, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grades 0 and 1, and myocardial blush scores 0 and 1 showed that a significantly higher number of patients in the {ED} group experienced at least 1 of the composite events in comparison with the patients in the {HAC} group (P = .01). 
Conclusion 
A direct-access catheter laboratory ({HAC)} model of {PPCI} bypassing the {ED} should be the favored approach to service delivery with superior outcome.},

@article{patel_pre-hospital_2012,
	Abstract = {Objectives 
This study sought to measure the impact of pre-hospital ({PH)} electrocardiography ({ECG)} on scene-to-hospital time for patients with chest pain of cardiac origin and those with {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} 
Background 
Pre-hospital {ECG} decreases door-to balloon ({D2B)} time for {STEMI} patients. However, obtaining a {PH} {ECG} might prolong scene time. We investigated the impact of obtaining a {PH} {ECG} on both scene and transport times for patients with chest pain suspected of cardiac origin. 
Methods 
City of San Diego Emergency Medical System runsheets of patients with chest pain from January 2003 to April 2008 were analyzed. The scene times and transport times were compared before (from January 2003 to December 2005) and after (from January 2006 to April 2008) implementation of the {PH} {ECG.} Among patients with a {PH} {ECG}, median scene times and transport times were compared in patients with and without {STEMI.} 
Results 
There were 21,742 patients evaluated for chest pain during the study period. Implementation of {PH} {ECG} resulted in minimal increases in median scene time (19 min, 10 s vs. 19 min, 28 s, p = 0.002) and transport time (13 min, 16 s vs. 13 min, 28 s, p = 0.007). However, compared with chest pain patients, in {STEMI} patients (n = 303), shorter median scene time (17 min, 51 s vs. 19 min, 31 s, p \&lt; 0.001), transport time (12 min, 34 s vs. 13 min, 31 s, p = 0.006), and scene-to-hospital time was observed (30 min, 45 s vs. 33 min, 29 s, p \&lt; 0.001). 
Conclusions 
Obtaining a {PH} {ECG} for patients with chest pain minimally prolongs scene and transport times. Further, for {STEMI} patients, both scene times and transport times are actually reduced leading to a potential reduction in total ischemic time.},

@article{gregg_automated_2012-1,
	Abstract = {Background 
Classifying the location of an occlusion in the culprit artery during {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} is important for risk stratification to optimize treatment. We developed a new logistic regression ({LR)} algorithm for 3-group classification of occlusion location as proximal right coronary artery ({RCA)}, middle-to-distal {RCA} or left circumflex ({LCx)} coronary artery with inferior myocardial infarction. We compared the performance of the new {LR} algorithm with the recently introduced decision tree classifier of Fiol et al (Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol. 2004;4:383-388) in the classification of the same 3 categories. 
Methods 
The new algorithm was developed on a set of electrocardiograms from an emergency department setting (n = 64) and tested on a different set from a prehospital setting (n = 68). All patients met the current {STEMI} criteria with angiographic confirmation of culprit artery and occlusion location. Using {LR}, 4 {ST-segment} deviation features were chosen by forward stepwise selection. Final {LR} coefficients were obtained by averaging more than 200 bootstrap iterations on the training set. In addition, a separate 4-feature classifier was designed adding {ST} features of {V4R} and V8, only available in the training set. 
Results 
The {LR} algorithm classified proximal {RCA} occlusion vs combined {LCx} occlusion and middle-to-distal {RCA} occlusion, with a sensitivity of 76\% and specificity of 81\% as compared with 71\% and 62\% for the Fiol classifier. The difference in specificity was statistically significant. The {LR} classifier trained with additional {ST} features of {V4R} and V8, but still limited to 4, improved the overall agreement in the training set from 65\% to 70\%. 
Conclusion 
Discrimination of proximal {RCA} lesion location from {LCx} or middle-to-distal {RCA} using the new {LR} classifier shows improvement over decision tree--type classification criteria. Automated identification of proximal {RCA} occlusion could speed up the risk stratification of patients with {STEMI.} The addition of leads {V4R} and V8 should further improve the automated classification of the occlusion site in {RCA} and {LCx.}},

@article{ducas_transmit_2012,
	Abstract = {Background 
There is growing use of prehospital electrocardiograms ({ECGs)} in establishing early diagnosis of {ST} segment myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} to facilitate early reperfusion. This study aimed to determine the predictive value of prehospital {ECGs} interpreted by nonphysician emergency medical services ({EMS)} in chest pain presentations. 
Methods 
In our city of 658,700 people, {EMS/paramedics} received 21 hours of instruction on {STEMI} management, {ECG} acquisition, and interpretation. Suspected {STEMI} {ECGs} were wirelessly transmitted to and discussed with a physician for possible therapy. {ECGs} deemed negative for {STEMI} by {EMS} were not transmitted; patients were transported to the closest hospital without prehospital physician involvement. 
Results 
From July 21, 2008 to July 21, 2010, there were 5426 chest pain calls to {EMS}, 380 were suspected {STEMI} cases. The remaining {ECGs} were deemed negative for {STEMI} by {EMS.} To audit the nontransmitted {ECGs} we analyzed 323 consecutive patients over 2 selected months (January and June 2010) for comparison. Of nontransmitted cases there was 1 missed and 2 {STEMIs} that developed subsequently. Based on 380 transmitted and 323 nontransmitted cases, the sensitivity and specificity of {EMS} detecting {STEMI} were 99.6\% and 67.6\%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for {STEMI} were 59.5\% and 99.7\%, respectively. 
Conclusions 
Our findings demonstrate nonphysician {EMS} interpretation of {STEMI} on prehospital {ECG} has excellent sensitivity and high negative predictive value. This finding supports the use of prehospital {ECGs} interpreted by {EMS} to help identify and facilitate treatment of {STEMI.} These results may have broad implications on staffing models for first {responder/EMS} units.},

	Abstract = {Background 
Guidelines for reperfusion in {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} were recently adopted by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society. We have developed a blended model of prehospital thrombolytic ({PHL)} therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PPCI)} activation, in order to achieve guideline times. 
Methods 
In our urban centre of 658,700 people, emergency medical services ({EMS)} were trained to perform and screen electrocardiograms ({ECGs)} for suspected {STEMI.} Suspected {ECGs} were transmitted to a physician's hand-held device. If the physician confirmed the diagnosis they coordinated initiation of either {PHL} or {PPCI.} In cases where physicians found the prehospital {ECG} negative for {STEMI} ({PHENST)}, patients were transported to the closest emergency room. 
Results 
From July 21, 2008 to July 21, 2010, the Cardiac Outcomes Through Digital Evaluation ({CODE)} {STEMI} project received 380 transmitted calls. There were 226 confirmed {STEMI} by the on-call physician, 158 (70\%) received {PPCI}, 48 (21\%) received {PHL}, and 20 (9\%) had angiography but no revascularization. The {PPCI}, median time from first medical contact to reperfusion was 76 minutes (interquartile range [{IQR]}, 64-93). For {PHL}, median time from first medical contact to needle was 32 minutes ({IQR}, 29-39). The overall mortality rate for the {STEMI} patients was 8\% ({PHL} = 4 [8.3\%], {PPCI} = 8 [5\%], medical therapy = 7 [35\%]). There were 154 {PHENST} patients, 44\% later diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome. The mortality rate for {PHENST} was 14\%. 
Conclusions 
Through a model of {EMS} prehospital {ECG} interpretation, digital transmission, direct communication with a physician, and rapid coordinated service, we demonstrate that benchmark reperfusion times in {STEMI} can be achieved.},

	Abstract = {Background 
Door-to-balloon ({D2B)} time is conceived as a crucial parameter for evaluating the quality of acute {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} care. Ideally, primary percutaneous intervention should be performed within 90 min of hospital arrival. 
Objectives 
We sought to determine the impact of emergency physician-activated {``Code} {STEMI''} protocol on door-to-balloon times during off-hours. 
Methods 
Patients were divided into two study groups: one group consisted of 27 {STEMI} patients who presented during off-hours in the pre-Code {STEMI} period (January to December 2006) and the second group consisted of 60 {STEMI} patients admitted during off-hours when Code {STEMI} was fully operational (January 2007 to December 2008). The primary objective was to compare median {D2B} times in both the study groups. Secondary parameters of interest included the individual components of {D2B} time, peak serum troponin levels, peak creatine kinase total levels, all-cause in-hospital mortality, 6-month all-cause mortality, and 12-month all-cause mortality. 
Results 
With the implementation of {``Code} {STEMI''} protocol, the median {D2B} time during off-hours dropped to 77 min (interquartile range [{IQR]} 67--95), representing a 52-min improvement (p = 0.0001). {ECG-to-catheterization} laboratory time demonstrated absolute reduction of 16 min. Median peak troponin-I levels dropped from 62 {ng/mL} ({IQR} 23--142) to 25 {ng/mL} ({IQR} 7--43; p \&lt; 0.002). No statistically significant differences were perceived in all-cause mortality among the study groups. 
Conclusions 
Implementation of {``Code} {STEMI''} protocol at our institution significantly reduced {D2B} times for {STEMI} during off-hours.},

@article{glickman_development_2012,
	Abstract = {Background 
Current guidelines recommend an immediate (eg, \&lt;10 minutes) 12-lead electrocardiogram ({ECG)} to identify {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} among patients presenting to the emergency department ({ED)} with chest pain. Yet, one third of all patients with myocardial infarction do not have chest pain. Our objective was to develop a practical approach to identify patients, especially those without chest pain, who require an immediate {ECG} in the {ED} to identify {STEMI.} 
Methods 
An {ECG} prioritization rule was derived and validated using classification and regression tree analysis among \&gt;3 million {ED} visits to 107 {EDs} from 2007 to 2008. 
Results 
The final study population included 3,575,178 {ED} patient visits; of these, 6,464 (0.18\%) were diagnosed with {STEMI.} Overall, 1,413 (21.9\%) of patients with {STEMI} did not present to the {ED} with chest pain. Major predictors of those requiring an immediate {ECG} in the {ED} included age ≥30 years with chest pain; age ≥50 years with shortness of breath, altered mental status, upper extremity pain, syncope, or generalized weakness; and those with age ≥80 years with abdominal pain or nausea/vomiting. When the {ECG} prioritization rule was applied to a validation sample, it had a sensitivity of 91.9\% (95\% {CI} 90.9\%-92.8\%) for {STEMI} and a negative predictive value 99.98\% (95\% {CI} 99.98\%-99.98\%). 
Conclusion 
A simple {ECG} prioritization rule based on age and presenting symptoms in the {ED} can identify patients during triage who are at high risk for {STEMI} and therefore should receive an immediate 12-lead {ECG}, often before they are seen by a physician.},

@article{khan_posterior_2012,
	Abstract = {Introduction Isolated posterior {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} accounts for up to 7\% of {STEMIs.} The diagnosis is suggested by indirect anterior-lead {ECG} changes. Confirmation requires presence of {ST-elevation} in posterior-leads ({V7--V9).} We investigated the ability of hospital doctors and paramedics to diagnose posterior {STEMI} ({PMI).}
Methods Doctors in the emergency department and acute medical unit at two teaching hospitals and West Midlands Ambulance Service Paramedics were asked to interpret a 12-lead {ECG} illustrating {ST-depression} and dominant R-wave in V1-V2 in the context of cardiac chest pain, and identify {PMI} as a potential diagnosis. Their ability to identify {PMI} was compared with their ability to diagnose anterolateral {STEMI} on a 12-lead {ECG.} We assessed whether doctors knew that posterior-leads were required to confirm {PMI} and whether doctors and nurses could position posterior-leads.
Results 44 of the 117 doctors (38\%) identified {PMI} as a potential diagnosis. {PMI} was identified by 73\% of registrars, 30\% of senior house-officers and 18\% of house-officers. 50\% of doctors who identified potential {PMI} knew that posterior-leads were required to confirm the diagnosis. 20\% of doctors correctly positioned these and 19\% knew the diagnostic criteria for {PMI} ({ST-elevation} ≥1 mm in {V7--V9).} 13 of the 60 nurses (22\%) in the emergency department and acute medical unit correctly positioned posterior-leads. Five of the 50 (10\%) paramedics identified {PMI} as a potential diagnosis. Doctors and paramedics were significantly better at diagnosing anterolateral {STEMI} than {PMI.}
Conclusions A significant proportion of doctors and paramedics were unable to diagnose {PMI.} Hence, the majority of {PMIs} may be being missed. Routine use of posterior-leads in the standard assessment of patients with chest pain may identify up to an additional 7\% of {STEMIs}, allowing prompt reperfusion therapy, which would reduce morbidity and mortality.},

@article{terkelsen_primary_2011,
	Abstract = {{Background---In} Denmark, primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PPCI)} was chosen as a national reperfusion strategy for patients with {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction in 2003. This study describes the temporal implementation of {PPCI} in Western Denmark, the gradual introduction of field triage for {PPCI} (patients rerouted from the scene of the event directly to the invasive center), and the associated outcome.
Methods and {Results---The} study population comprised 9514 patients treated with {PPCI} from 1999 to 2009 with symptom duration ≤12 hours and either a delay from the emergency medical service ({EMS)} call to {PPCI} (healthcare system delay) of ≤6 hours or as self-presenters. The median follow-up time was 3.7 years. The number of patients treated with {PPCI} increased from 190 in 1999 to 1212 in 2009. Among patients transported by the {EMS} from the scene of the event, the proportion who were field triaged directly to a {PCI} center increased from 33\% (34/103) to 72\% (616/851, P{\textless}0.001). Patients who were field triaged had lower long-term mortality, with adjusted hazard ratios (95\% {CI)} of 1.26 (1.12--1.43) among patients transported by the {EMS} to a local hospital and then transferred, 1.28 (1.10--1.49) among patients self-presenting at a local hospital and then transferred, and 1.37 (1.18--1.58) among patients self-presenting at a {PCI} center.
{Conclusions---A} reperfusion strategy with {PPCI} only for patients with {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction was successfully implemented in Western Denmark, and the majority of patients transported by the {EMS} are now triaged directly to the {PPCI} centers. This strategy is associated with lower mortality.},

@article{seo_st_2011,
	Abstract = {Purpose 
Few studies specify the methods used to measure {ST-segment} elevation ({STE).} We therefore assessed differences in electrocardiography results depending on {STE} measurement methods for patients with inferior acute myocardial infarction ({MI)} and right ventricular infarction. 
Methods 
This study was a retrospective analysis. The {STE} group consisted of 88 patients consecutively admitted to the emergency department with inferior {ST} elevation {MI} associated with occlusion of right coronary artery or left circumflex coronary artery who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The control group consisted of 109 patients with {non--ST} elevation {MI} who had occlusion of right coronary artery or left circumflex coronary artery and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Measurements were performed at the J point and 60 milliseconds later for limb lead and right precordial V4 lead ({V4R).} The criterion of at least 1-mm {STE} in 2 consecutive leads was applied, and the diagnostic accuracy of {V4R} was calculated. 
Results 
In the {STE} group, the measurements 60 milliseconds after the J point were significantly higher than measurements at the J point at the {II}, {III}, {aVF}, and {V4R} leads. In the control group, only the measurements at lead I differed significantly. There was a 5\% difference in diagnostic sensitivity depending on the measuring points in the {STE} group, a 1\% to 3\% difference in the control group, and a 10\% to 11\% difference at the {V4R} lead. 
Conclusion 
In patients with inferior {MI}, {STE} depends on the method of measurement, indicating a need for the standardization of measurements.},

@article{armstrong_reperfusion_2011,
	Abstract = {A transformation in {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} care in the United States has unfolded. It asserts superior reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PPCI)} over fibrinolysis on the basis of studies showing the former method to be superior for reperfusion of patients with {STEMI.} Although clear benefit has resulted from national programs directed toward achieving shorter times to {PPCI} in facilities with around-the-clock access, most patients present to non-{PPCI} hospitals. Because delay to {PPCI} for most patients with {STEMI} presenting to non-{PPCI} centers remains outside current guidelines, many are denied benefit from pharmacologic therapy. This article describes why this approach creates a treatment paradox in which more effort to improve treatment for patients with {PPCI} for acute {STEMI} often leads to unnecessary avoidance and delay in the use of fibrinolysis. Recent evidence confirms the unfavorable consequences of delay to {PPCI} and that early prehospital fibrinolysis combined with strategic mechanical co-interventions affords excellent outcomes. The authors believe it is time to embrace an integrated dual reperfusion strategy to best serve all patients with {STEMI.}},

@article{thiele_randomized_2011,
	Abstract = {Objectives 
This multicenter trial sought to assess the merits of facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI)} versus primary {PCI} in an {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} network with long transfer distances in patients presenting early after symptom onset. 
Background 
Facilitated {PCI} with fibrinolysis might be beneficial in specific high-risk {STEMI} situations to prevent myocardial necrosis expansion. 
Methods 
Patients with {STEMI} (\&lt;3 h after symptom onset) were randomized to either pre-hospital--initiated facilitated {PCI} using tenecteplase (Group A; n = 81) or primary {PCI} (Group B; n = 81) plus optimal antithrombotic comedication. The primary endpoint was infarct size assessed by delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary endpoints were microvascular obstruction and myocardial salvage, early {ST-segment} resolution, and a composite of death, repeated myocardial infarctions, and congestive heart failure within 30 days. 
Results 
The median time from symptom onset to randomization was 64 min (interquartile range [{IQR]:} 42 to 103 min) in Group A versus 55 min in Group B ({IQR:} 27 to 91 min; p = 0.26). Despite better pre-interventional {TIMI} (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow in Group A (71\% vs. 35\% {TIMI} flow grade 2 or 3; p \&lt; 0.001), the infarct size tended to be worse in Group A versus Group B (17.9\% of left ventricle [{IQR:} 8.4\% to 35.0\%] vs. 13.7\% [{IQR:} 7.5\% to 24.0\%]; p = 0.10). There was also a strong trend toward more early and late microvascular obstruction, (p = 0.06 and 0.09) and no difference in {ST-segment} resolution (p = 0.26). The combined clinical endpoint showed a trend toward higher event rates in Group A (19.8\% vs. 13.6\%; p = 0.13, relative risk: 0.52, 95\% confidence interval: 0.23 to 1.18). 
Conclusions 
In {STEMI} patients presenting early after symptom onset with relatively long transfer times, a fibrinolytic-based facilitated {PCI} approach with optimal antiplatelet comedication does not offer a benefit over primary {PCI} with respect to infarct size and tissue perfusion.

@article{chughtai_prehospital_2011,
	Abstract = {Purposes 
We performed this study to assess the impact of pre-hospital time on the patient's outcome. 
Procedures 
Starting from the symptoms onset, ``total time to treatment'' was divided into less than or equal to 120 minutes and more than 120 minutes (``pre-hospital time'' of ≤ or \&gt; 30 minutes respectively). Adverse patient's outcomes were compared in the two subgroups. 
Findings 
Our patients had a mean age of 63 ($\pm$13) years. On-scene time (17.8 $\pm$ 9.4 minutes), was the biggest fraction of ``pre-hospital time''. Comparing the groups with {``Total} time to treatment'' of \&gt;120 minutes vs. $\pm$120 minutes (``pre-hospital time'' of \&gt;30 vs. ≤30 minutes), mortalities were 4 vs. 0 and transfers to a tertiary care facility were 3 vs.1. 
Conclusions 
Most of the pre-hospital time in {STEMI} was spent on the scene and we suggest ``total time to treatment'' as a core measure instead of ``door to balloon time''.},

	Abstract = {Objective To describe the effects of implementing of a percutaneous coronary intervention ({PPCI)} service and compare the distribution of reperfusion therapies 12 months pre and post introduction of {PPCI.}
Design Observational study with data collected 12 months pre and post-availability of Primary {PCI} as routine treatment.
Setting Lothian region in South-East Scotland.
Patients 625 Patients who received reperfusion treatment between December 2005 and November 2007.
Results {PHT} was given to 96/328 patients (29\%) prior to availability of {PPCI} as routine treatment. Following routine availability, {PPCI} was delivered to 248/297 patients who received reperfusion treatment (84\%). Median diagnosis-to-{PCI} balloon inflation time and hospital door-to-balloon time were 84 and 54 min, respectively. Patients received {PPCI} balloon inflation within 90 min of diagnosis in 60\% of cases. {PPCI-related} delay was 74 min compared with prehospital thrombolysis ({PHT).} {PHT} (152 min) and {PPCI} (166 min) had shorter symptom onset-to-assessment of reperfusion times than in-hospital thrombolysis ({IHT)} (226 min).
Conclusions More than two-thirds of the total-ischaemic-time in ({ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction) {STEMI} occurs before the patient reaches hospital, with less than one-third being accounted for by door-to-needle ({IHT)} or door-to-balloon ({PPCI)} time. The magnitude of difference in the time between symptom onset-and-assessment of reperfusion treatment efficacy is short and should be considered, particularly in patients treated with thrombolysis in hospitals without cath-lab facilities. Optimal reperfusion treatment including a combination of {PHT}, {IHT} and {PPCI}, as recommended in international guidelines, is feasible in the {UK} although the balance between the use of different treatments will differ between urban and rural areas.},

	Abstract = {Objectives  
 The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of the {STAT-MI} ({ST-Segment} Analysis Using Wireless Technology in Acute Myocardial Infarction) network on outcomes in the treatment of patients presenting with {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI).Background}  
 Shortening door-to-balloon ({D2B)} time remains a national priority for the treatment of {STEMI.} We previously reported a fully automated wireless network ({STAT-MI)} for transmission of electrocardiograms ({ECGs)} for suspected {STEMI} from the field to offsite cardiologists, allowing early triage with shortening of subsequent {D2B} times. We now report the impact of the {STAT-MI} wireless network on infarct size, length of hospital stay ({LOS)}, and {mortality.Methods}  
 A fully automated wireless network ({STAT-MI)} was developed to enable automatic 12-lead {ECG} transmission and direct communication between emergency medical services personnel and offsite cardiologists that facilitated direct triage of patients to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Demographic, laboratory, and time interval data of {STAT-MI} network patients were prospectively collected over a 33-month period and compared with concurrent control patients who presented with {STEMI} through {non--STAT-MI} {pathways.Results}  
 From June 2006 through February 2009, 92 patients presented via the {STAT-MI} network, and 50 patients presented through {non--STAT-MI} pathways (control group). Baseline clinical and demographic variables were similar in both groups. Overall, compared with control subjects, {STAT-MI} patients had significantly shorter {D2B} times (63 [42 to 87] min vs. 119 [96 to 178] min, U = 779.5, p {\textless} 0.00004), significantly lower peak troponin I (39.5 [11 to 120.5] ng/ml vs. 87.6 [38.4 to 227] ng/ml, U = 889.5, p = 0.005) and creatine phosphokinase-{MB} (126.1 [37.2 to 280.5] ng/ml vs. 290.3 [102.4 to 484] ng/ml, U = 883, p = 0.001), higher left ventricular ejection fractions (50\% [35 to 55] vs. 35\% [25 to 52], U = 1,075, p = 0.004), and shorter {LOS} (3 [2 to 4] days vs. 5.5 [3.5 to 10.5] days, U = 378, p {\textless} {0.001).Conclusions}  
 A fully automated, field-based, wireless network that transmits {ECGs} automatically to offsite cardiologists for the early evaluation and triage of patients with {STEMI} shortens {D2B} times, reduces infarct size, limits ejection fraction reduction, and shortens {LOS.}},

	Abstract = {Aims Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI)} is the preferred treatment for {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} The distance to primary {PCI} centres and the inherent time delay in delivering primary {PCI}, however, limit widespread use of this treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of pre-hospital diagnosis on time from emergency medical services contact to balloon inflation (system delay) in an unselected cohort of patients with {STEMI} recruited from a large geographical area comprising both urban and rural districts.
Methods and results From February 2004 until January 2007, data on pre-hospital timing and transport distance were prospectively recorded. Patients were divided into groups depending on achievement of pre-hospital diagnosis and/or direct referral to a primary {PCI} centre. Seven hundred and fifty-nine consecutive {STEMI} patients were included. In patients with a pre-hospital diagnosis and direct referral, the system delay was 92 vs. 153 min in patients without pre-hospital diagnosis (P{\textless} 0.001). Patients from rural areas were transported a median of 30 km longer than patients from urban areas; however, this prolonged the system delay by only 9 min.
Conclusion Pre-hospital electrocardiographic ({ECG)} diagnosis and direct referral for primary {PCI} enables {STEMI} patients living far from a {PCI} centre to achieve a system delay comparable with patients living in close vicinity of a {PCI} centre.},

	Abstract = {Although the American Heart Association recommends a prehospital electrocardiogram ({ECG)} be recorded for all patients who access the emergency medical system with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome ({ACS)}, widespread use of prehospital {ECG} has not been achieved in the United States. A 5-year prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in a predominately rural county in northern California to test a simple strategy for acquiring and transmitting prehospital {ECGs} that involved minimal paramedic training and decision making. A 12-lead {ECG} was synthesized from 5 electrodes and continuous {ST-segment} monitoring was performed with {ST-event} {ECGs} automatically transmitted to the destination hospital emergency department. Patients randomized to the experimental group had their {ECGs} printed out in the emergency department with an audible voice alarm, whereas control patients had an {ECG} after hospital arrival, as was the standard of care in the county. The result was that nearly 3/4 (74\%) of 4,219 patients with symptoms of {ACS} over the 4-year study enrollment period had a prehospital {ECG.} Mean time from 911 call to first {ECG} was 20 minutes in those with a prehospital {ECG} versus 79 minutes in those without a prehospital {ECG} (p \&lt;0.0001). Mean paramedic scene time in patients with a prehospital {ECG} was just 2 minutes longer than in those without a prehospital {ECG} (95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.6, p \&lt;0.001). Patients with {non--ST-elevation} myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris had a faster time to first intravenous drug and there was a suggested trend for a faster door-to-balloon time and lower risk of mortality in patients with {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction. In conclusion, increased paramedic use of prehospital {ECGs} and decreased hospital treatment times for {ACS} are feasible with a simple approach tailored to characteristics of a local geographic region.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Percutaneous coronary intervention for {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} reduces morbidity and mortality if performed rapidly. We examined whether timely intervention in myocardial perfusion times achieved at {NorthEast} Medical Center ({NEMC)} using pre-hospital ({PH)} electrocardiography ({ECG)} could be maintained during a 3-year follow-up period, and whether a similar system could be implemented at 6 other larger hospitals in a prospective, multicenter study.
{METHODS:} We calculated median door-to-reperfusion times for emergency medical services ({EMS)} and self-transport patients. {PH} wireless {ECG} transmission was attempted by trained {EMS} personnel with transmission to an on-call cardiologist's hand-held device. A standardized {"STEMI} code system" was implemented to further improve door-to-reperfusion times.
{RESULTS:} At {NEMC}, door-to-reperfusion times were similar in both the pilot study and follow-up periods, with a median time of 63 minutes. However, successful {PH-ECG} transmission was less frequent during the followup period (20\% vs. 56\%; p {\textless} 0.0001). At the 6 larger sites, both {EMS} and self-transport patients had lower door-to-reperfusion times in the study period compared to the pre-study period. However, successful {PH-ECG} transmission was rare in the {EMS-transported} patients (2\%).
{CONCLUSION:} Initial reduction of reperfusion time at {NEMC} using {PH-ECG} transmission to the cardiologist was maintained over time, however, there was a decrease in the {PH-ECG} transmission rate. {PHECG} transmission was difficult to achieve in larger-sized communities. Successful {PH-ECG} transmission to an on-call cardiologist, together with an effective {STEMI} code system, can markedly reduce door-to-reperfusion times.},

	Abstract = {Introduction 
Telemedicine allows exchange of information and has therefore become an important tool for optimizing patient treatment in the field of cardiology. Transmission of electrocardiograms ({ECGs)} from the prehospital setting to the receiving hospital is the most widespread technology in the prehospital setting. Providing a diagnostic {ECG} from patients with acute coronary syndromes to health care professionals with decision-making power has proven pivotal for an early diagnosis, ideal triage, and initiation of reperfusion therapy of the large group of patients presenting with {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} This urgent triage could be expanded to several diagnosis in cardiology, primarily the {non--ST-elevation} presenters. 
Purpose 
The purpose of the present article is to briefly describe the history the teletransmitted {ECG} and some of the recent results obtained when used in routine practice for acute triage and referral for primary percutaneous coronary intervention. 
Conclusions 
Transmitting 12-lead {ECGs} from the community directly to attending cardiologists should become routine. Time to reperfusion in {STEMI} has decreased, explaining much of the observed decrease in {STEMI} mortality. This technology allows for increasingly complex and individualized prehospital medical care and could be expanded to a broader number of cardiovascular diagnoses.},

	Abstract = {Objectives 
We sought to study the impact of direct referral to an intervention center after pre-hospital diagnosis of {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} on treatment intervals and outcome. 
Background 
Primary angioplasty has become the preferred reperfusion strategy in {STEMI.} Ambulance diagnosis and direct referral to an intervention center is an attractive treatment option that has not been studied extensively. 
Methods 
Consecutive pre-hospital patients with {STEMI}, who were referred to our intervention center for primary angioplasty between 2005 and 2007, were studied. After pre-hospital diagnosis, patients were either directly transported to our center or referred through a nonintervention center. The catheterization laboratory was activated before transport to the intervention center. 
Results 
Of the 581 patients referred, 454 (78\%) came with direct transport and 127 (22\%) through a nonintervention center. Direct transport was associated with a higher proportion of patients treated within the 90-min time window of the {STEMI} guidelines: 82\% versus 23\% (p \&lt; 0.01). Patients directly transported had a significantly shorter median symptom-to-balloon time of 149 min (Interquartile range: 118 to 197 min) versus 219 min (interquartile range: 178 to 315 min), p \&lt; 0.01, a higher post-procedural Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction ({TIMI)} flow grade 3 rate (92\% vs. 84\%; p = 0.03), and a lower 1-year mortality rate (7\% vs. 13\%; p = 0.03). Direct transport to the intervention center was independently associated with the symptom-to-balloon time, which in turn was an independent predictor of post-procedural {TIMI} flow grade 3, a strong prognosticator of outcome. 
Conclusions 
After ambulance-based diagnosis of {STEMI}, direct transport to an intervention center with pre-hospital notification of the catheterization laboratory more than triples the proportion of patients treated within the time window of the guidelines. Time to balloon was an independent predictor of post-procedural {TIMI} flow grade 3, which underscores the need to reduce treatment delays.},

	Abstract = {Background 
Although advanced prehospital management ({PHM)} in {ST} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} reduces reperfusion delay and improves patient outcomes, its use in North America remains uncommon. Understanding perceived barriers to and facilitators of {PHM} implementation may support the expansion of programs, with associated patient benefit. 
Objective 
To explore the attitudes and beliefs of paramedics, cardiologists, emergency physicians and nurses regarding these issues. 
Methods 
To maximize the potential to identify unpredictable issues within each of the four groups, focus group sessions were recorded, transcribed and analyzed for themes using the constant comparative method. 
Results 
All 18 participants believed that {PHM} of {STEMI} decreased time to treatment and improved health outcomes. Despite agreeing that most paramedics were capable of providing {PHM}, regular maintenance of competence and medical overview were emphasized. Significant variations in perceptions were revealed regarding practical aspects of the {PHM} process and protocol, as well as ownership and responsibility of the patient. Success and failures of technology were also expressed. Varying arguments against a signed `informed consent' were presented by the majority. 
Conclusions 
Focus group discussions provided key insights into potential barriers to and facilitators of {PHM} in {STEMI.} Although all groups were supportive of the concept and its benefits, concerns were expressed and potential barriers identified. This novel body of knowledge will help elucidate future educational programs and protocol development, and identify future challenges to ensure successful {PHM} of {STEMI}, thereby reducing reperfusion delay and improving patient outcomes.},

	Abstract = {Introduction: Prehospital thrombolysis has been shown to improve patient outcomes in clinical trials and this has been confirmed in the ongoing large national myocardial infarction registry (Myocardial Infarction National Audit Project; {MINAP)} reports. This paper describes a system to improve the delivery of prehospital thrombolysis and the associated governance requirements to gain maximum patient benefit.
Methods: Demographic data were prospectively collected on all patients treated by the East Anglian Ambulance Trust with bolus thrombolytics for a presumed diagnosis of {ST} elevation myocardial infarction between November 2003 and February 2007. Survival status was determined from the {NHS} strategic tracing service.
Results: 1062 patients (mean age 64.0 years ({SD} 10.6), 795 men) were treated in this time period. There were 71 deaths in this group, with actuarial survival of 93.9\% ({SE} 0.9\%) at 30 days, 91.7\% ({SE} 1.0\%) at 6 months and 90.8\% ({SE} 1.1\%) at 12 months after treatment. Age and cardiac arrest were most strongly associated with mortality (both p{\textless}0.001). Twelve (1.2\%) patients received thrombolysis that on review was considered inappropriate. There were no deaths in this subgroup.
Conclusions: Prehospital thrombolysis can be administered safely by ambulance staff supported by a Trust clinical support system with excellent clinical outcomes.},

@article{rajabali_evaluation_2009,
	Abstract = {Introduction: In {ST} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)}, prehospital management ({PHM)} may improve clinical outcomes through a reduction in reperfusion delay. The purpose of this study was to evaluate perceptions among healthcare stakeholder groups relating to the barriers and facilitators of implementing a {PHM} programme.
Methods: A 25-question cross-sectional survey, using a four-point Likert scale assessing barriers and facilitators of {PHM}, was distributed to paramedics, cardiologists, emergency physicians and emergency nurses within the Edmonton region, where prehospital {STEMI} treatment is established. The proportion of responses on each question was compared and differences between groups were determined using χ2 and Fisher's exact tests.
Results: 57\% (355/619) of subjects responded: 69\% paramedics, 50\% cardiologists, 54\% emergency physicians and 45\% emergency nurses. A majority believed {PHM} reduced treatment delays in both rural (96--100\%) and urban (86--96\%) areas, while decreasing patient mortality (paramedics 97\%, cardiologists 74\%, emergency physicians 85\%, emergency nurses 88\%). Regarding the capability of paramedics to deliver {PHM}, paramedics 25\%, cardiologists 33\%, emergency physicians 67\%, and emergency nurses 47\% stated that urban paramedics are better equipped and trained than rural paramedics. Although 81\% of paramedics supported the possibility of {PHM} delivery without physician overview, 0\% of cardiologists, 98\% of emergency physicians and 95\% emergency nurses agreed. A majority (71--88\%) favoured mandatory signed informed consent.
Conclusions: While stakeholders agreed on the benefits of {PHM}, perceptual differences existed on paramedics' ability to deliver {PHM} without physician overview. Addressing real and perceived barriers through communication and educational programmes may enhance {PHM} within this healthcare region and facilitate the implementation of {PHM} programmes.},

	Abstract = {Shorter reperfusion times lead to better outcomes in patients with {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} We assessed the efficacy of prehospital triage with bypass of community hospitals and early activation of the cardiac catheterization team on revascularization times, left ventricular ({LV)} ejection fraction, and survival. Patients with {STEMI} (624) were divided into 3 groups determined by site of triage: ambulance field triage (163), interventional center emergency department (202), and 3 community hospital emergency departments (259). Compared with community hospital and interventional center triages, ambulance field triage resulted in a significant median decrease in door-to-balloon times of 68 and 27 minutes, respectively (p \&lt;0.001). {LV} ejection fraction was highest in the field triage group (52 $\pm$ 13\%) compared with the interventional center (49 $\pm$ 12\%) and community hospital (48 $\pm$ 12\%, p = 0.017) groups. Thirty-day mortality was lowest in the ambulance field group (3\%) compared with the interventional facility (11\%) and community hospital (4\%, p = 0.007) groups. There was a significant difference in long-term survival with up to 30-month follow-up among the 3 triage groups (p = 0.041). With time-dependent Cox regression modeling the difference in survival was significant only during the first week after {STEMI} (p = 0.020). Every extra minute of symptom onset to reperfusion time was associated with a relative risk of long-term mortality of 1.003 (95\% confidence interval 1.000 to 1.006, p = 0.027). In conclusion, field triage of patient with {STEMI} decreased revascularization times, which preserved {LV} function, and improved early survival.},

@article{terkelsen_primary_2009,
	Abstract = {There is a continuing controversy about the acceptable time-window for primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PPCI)} in patients with {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} Recent American and European guidelines recommend {PPCI} if the delay in performing {PPCI} instead of administering fibrinolysis ({PCI-related} delay) is {\textless}60 min and the presentation delay is more than 3 h. Based on a review of the literature, this viewpoint recommends a revision of the guidelines. The evidence supports an acceptable {PCI-related} delay of 80--120 min and {PPCI} as the better reperfusion strategy also in the early incomers. Furthermore, the previous assumption that {PPCI} is less time-dependent than fibrinolysis is questioned. To maximise the number of patients with {STEMI} eligible for {PPCI} the optimal logistic may be to establish the diagnosis in the prehospital phase, to bypass local hospitals and re-route patients directly to catheterisation laboratories running 24/7.},

	Abstract = {Background
Pre-hospital delays in patients experiencing acute coronary syndromes ({ACS)} remain unacceptably long.

Aims
To examine simultaneously a wide range of clinical, sociodemographic and situational factors associated with total pre-hospital delay and its two components.

Methods
Pre-hospital delay data were collected from 228 patients with {ACS} using patient's medical notes and semi-structured interviews. Total pre-hospital delay (symptom onset to hospital admission) was divided into 2 components: decision time (symptom onset to call for medical help), and home-to-hospital delay (call for help to hospital admission).

Results
Shorter total pre-hospital delays and decision times were associated with {ST} segment myocardial infarction ({STEMI)}, recognizing symptoms as cardiac in origin, being married, symptom onset outside the home and the presence of a bystander. Shorter home-to-hospital delays were more likely among younger patients, those experiencing an {STEMI}, and patients reporting a greater number of symptoms. Initial contact with emergency medical services was related to shorter total delays and decision times.

Conclusions
Different factors were associated with shorter times in the 2 component phases. Greater understanding of the factors impacting on the component phases may help target interventions more effectively and reduce pre-hospital delays.},

	Abstract = {Objectives: To describe a prehospital thrombolysis ({PHT)} and expedited inhospital thrombolysis ({IHT)} programme in south-east Scotland using prehospital 12-lead {ECG} recordings transmitted by telemetry and autonomous paramedic-administered thrombolysis with decision support being provided by coronary care nurses.
Design: Retrospective observational study.
Setting: Three hospitals in south-east Scotland covering a population of 778 468 served by 54 ambulance vehicles.
Patients: 11 840 patients who telephoned the ambulance service with ``chest pain'' over 20 months, during which 812 patients were admitted with {ST} segment elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI).}
Main outcome measures: All calls and cardiac/potential cardiac calls to the ambulance service, type/time of patient presentation, symptoms/call/door-to-thrombolysis times.
Results: Of the 11 840 calls to the ambulance service for chest pain over 20 months of the initiative, 60\% were cardiac/potentially cardiac-related by Scottish Ambulance Service triage. {ST} segment elevation was present in 8\% of the 5150 12-lead {ECGs} transmitted by paramedics to the {ECG} receiving station in the {CCU.} Over the 20 months, 812 patients were admitted to the three hospitals with {STEMI} and 71\% received thrombolysis. Median symptom-to-thrombolysis times were 91, 148 and 184 min, respectively, in the {PHT}, telemetry-facilitated {IHT} and self-presenting {IHT} groups. Median call-to-needle time for the {PHT} group was 40 min. In 2/146 cases the cardiologists judged that the patient should not have been administered {PHT.}
Conclusions: Based on prehospital 12-lead {ECG} telemetry, it is possible for paramedics and {CCU} nurses to conduct live reperfusion decision-making in patients with {STEMI}, with resultant benefits in symptoms-to-thrombolysis time.},

                  Allowing the emergency department physician to activate the cardiac catheterization laboratory is a key strategy to reduce door-to-balloon times in patients with {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI).} There are limited data on the frequency of ``false-positive'' 
catheterization laboratory activation in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for suspected {STEMI.Objective}  
                  To determine the prevalence, etiology, and outcomes of false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activation in patients with a suspected {STEMI.Design}, Setting, and Patients  
                  Prospective registry from a regional system that includes transfer of patients with {STEMI} from 30 community and rural hospitals with pretransfer catheterization laboratory activation for percutaneous coronary intervention at a tertiary cardiovascular center in Minnesota. 
A total of 1345 patients were enrolled from March 2003 to November {2006.Main} Outcome Measure  
                  Prevalence of false-positive catheterization laboratory activation in patients with suspected {STEMI} by 3 criteria: no culprit coronary artery, no significant coronary artery disease, and negative cardiac biomarker {results.Results}  
                  Of the 1335 patients with suspected {STEMI} who underwent angiography, 
187 (14\%; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 12.2\%-16.0\%) had no culprit coronary artery and 127 (9.5\%; 95\% {CI}, 8.0\%-11.2\%) did not have significant coronary artery disease. Cardiac biomarker levels were negative in 11.2\% (95\% {CI}, 9.6\%-13.0\%) of patients. The combination of no culprit artery with negative cardiac biomarker results was present in 9.2\% 
(95\% {CI}, 7.7\%-10.9\%) of patients. Thirty-day mortality was 2.7\% (95\% 
{CI}, 0.4\%-5.0\%) without vs 4.6\% (95\% {CI}, 3.4\%-5.8\%) with a culprit coronary artery (P = {.33).Conclusions}  
                  The frequency of false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activation for suspected {STEMI} is relatively common in community practice, 
depending on the definition of false-positive. Recent emphasis on rapid door-to-balloon times must also consider the consequences of false-positive catheterization laboratory activation.},

	Abstract = {Elevation or depression of the {ST} segment of the 12-lead electrocardiogram is an important and established marker of myocardial ischemia or injury. The {ST} segment deviation in normal individuals using standard cardiac monitoring equipment in the clinical setting of prehospital transport has not been studied. The hypothesis that we tested is that {ST} segment changes do not occur in normal subjects on standard prehospital cardiac monitors during transport. During a simulated transport, we monitored healthy volunteers of both sexes between the ages of 20 and 30 who had a normal cardiovascular history, physical examination, and 12-lead electrocardiogram. Fourteen of 34 subjects (41\%) who qualified as normal exhibited {ST} segment deviation on the monitor. Of these 14, 11 exhibited {ST} segment depression, and 3 exhibited {ST} segment elevation. We conclude that normal individuals can exhibit {ST} segment deviation on standard prehospital cardiac monitoring equipment during routine transport.},

	Abstract = {Study objective: To determine retrospectively the diagnostic accuracy of various {ECG} {ST} segment elevation criteria for the prehospital {ECG} diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Design and setting: During a six-month period, paramedics acquired prehospital 12-lead {ECGs} on adult chest pain patients. Investigations interpreted {ECGs} independently, retrospectively, and blinded to patient outcome. {ECGs} were classified as meeting or not meeting the six {ST} segment elevation criteria regard-less of {ECG} morphology if the criteria were present in two or more anatomically contiguous leads: 1 mm or more {ST} segment elevation; 2 mm or more {ST} segment elevation; 1 mm or more {ST} segment elevation in the limb leads or 2 mm or more {ST} segment elevation in the precordial leads; and the first three criteria with the simultaneous presence of reciprocal changes. {ECGs} that did not meet any {ST} segment elevation criteria were classified as normal, nonspecific {ST/T} wave changes, abnormal but not ischemic, and ischemic. Hospital charts were reviewed for final cardiac diagnosis. Type of participant: Four hundred twenty-eight stable adult prehospital chest pain patients in whom paramedics acquired prehospital 12-lead {ECGs.} Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Of the 428 cases, 123 (29\%) met 1 mm or more {ST} segment elevation criteria. Sixty-three (51\%) of these 123 patients did not have myocardial infarctions. {ECG} characteristics most frequently associated with these non-myocardial infarction {ECGs} were left bundle branch block (21\%) and left ventricular hypertrophy (33\%). The three criteria that required the presence of reciprocal changes had the highest positive predictive values (93\% to 95\%), with sensitivities ranging from 20\% to 33\%. The criteria of 1 mm or more {ST} segment elevation with the simultaneous presence of reciprocal changes had a positive predictive value of 94\% and included 18 of the 21 (86\%) myocardial infarction patients who had {ST} segment elevation and received thrombolytic therapy within five hours after hospital arrival. Of the 428 cases, 305 (71\%) did not meet any {ST} segment elevation criteria and had a sensitivity of 81\% and a negative predictive value of 49\% for the absence of acute myocardial infarction. Conclusion: Fifty-one percent of patients whose prehospital 12-lead {ECG} met 1 mm or more {ST} segment elevation criteria had non-myocardial infarction diagnoses. {ST} segment elevation alone lacks the positive predictive value necessary for reliable prehospital myocardial infarction diagnosis. Inclusion of reciprocal changes in prehospital {ECG} myocardial infarction criteria improved the positive predictive value to more than 90\% and included a significant majority (62\% to 86\%) of acute myocardial infarction patients with {ST} segment elevation who received thrombolytic therapy within five hours after hospital arrival. {ST} segment elevation criteria that include reciprocal changes identify patients who stand to benefit most from early interventional strategies},

	Abstract = {Accurate and rapid electrocardiographic interpretation is of crucial importance in acute coronary syndrome ({ACS).} Computerized electrocardiographic algorithms are often used in out-of-hospital settings. Their accuracy should be carefully validated in {ACS}, particularly in {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction. This study evaluated the comparative accuracy of lead-specific computer-based versus manual measurements of the J-point, {ST-segment}, and T-wave deviations in standard 12-lead electrocardiograms ({ECGs)} (excluding lead {aVR).} Sixty-nine consecutive patients with suspected {ACS} were included. The interobserver reliability in the determination of {ST-segment} deviation ≥0.2 {mV} in leads V2 and V3 was very good (κ = 0.94 and 0.93, respectively). Agreement between a cardiologist and the computer regarding {ST} elevation ≥0.2 {mV} in lead V2 was moderate (κ = 0.72) and in V3 was very good (κ = 0.85). For {ST} depression or elevation ≥0.05 {mV} in lead {LIII}, agreement was good and moderate (κ = 0.79 and 0.51, respectively). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated clinically acceptable limits of agreement comparing measurements of the J point and the T wave, but clinically inadequate limits of agreement with respect to {ST-segment} deviation, between the electrocardiographer and the computer. The optimal cut-off points were 0.115 {mV} (sensitivity 89\%, specificity 98\%) for the computer program to detect {ST} elevation ≥0.2 {mV} and 0.045 {mV} (sensitivity 74\%, specificity 99\%) for revealing {ST} elevation ≥0.1 {mV.} It was found that automatically measured {ST-segment} deviations were smaller than those manually measured. In conclusion, a correction should be performed to obtain optimal results in the automated analysis of {ECGs}, because the results have important implications for clinical decision making.},

	Abstract = {Placement of precordial electrodes by 30 experienced technicians during routine electrocardiography was compared with anatomically ascertained sites marked by ink visible only under ultraviolet ``black light'' in three men and five women. The distance and direction from each marked site to the center of the applied electrode was measured to allow calculation of both the linear magnitude of difference (derived from the square root of the sum of the squares of rise and run) and also the direction of difference (in quadrants) between the anatomically established location and the electrode at each precordial site. The average difference from the applied electrodes to the corresponding marked sites was 1.14 inches, ranging from a mean of 1.31 inches at lead V1 to 0.98 inches at lead V4. Overall, 64\% of precordial electrodes were placed within a radius of 1.25 inch, ranging from 56\% for lead V6 to 74\% for lead V4, and 27\% of precordial electrodes were placed within a radius of 0.625 inch. There was superior quadrant displacement of more than 0.625 inch in more than 50\% of routine applications of leads V1 and V2, indicating that these electrodes are commonly placed both high and wide of their anatomically defined precordial sites. Similarly, there was an inferior and left-ward displacement of more than 0.625 inch in 30--50\% leads of routine applications of V4 through V6, indicating that these lateral precordial electrodes are commonly placed both low and wide of their respective anatomic sites.},

	Abstract = {Objectives: Misplaced {ECG} electrodes can cause changes in {ECG} recordings, which could have an impact on clinical decisions. We aimed to determine the inter-rater reliability of {ECG} electrode placement by senior clinical staff in the {ED.Methods:} A prospective observational study was conducted in adult patients undergoing an {ECG} as part of their routine {ED} care. Adhesive electrodes were left in place after an {ECG} had been performed by the treating nurse, and subsequently each patient was assessed by two of the three investigators. Each investigator independently recorded the location of the chest electrodes relative to the recommended standard positions. Displacement of the electrodes from the standard positions was measured in the vertical and horizontal planes. The age, sex, weight, height and chest circumference was also recorded. Comparisons were made between investigators to determine variability in assessment of the standard {positions.Results:} Measurement of horizontal and vertical displacement for each of the six chest leads in the 77 patients resulted in 924 paired measurements. There was substantial inter-rater variation in the measurement of both vertical (mean 13.5 mm, range 0--105 mm) and horizontal (mean 16.5 mm, range 0--120 mm) displacement. This variation was greater in the lateral chest leads and was more marked in women than in men, especially in the vertical plane (lead V6: men 14.5 mm vs women 27.0 mm, P {\textless} {0.01).Conclusion:} Among clinical `experts', there is wide variation in the identification of the correct location for electrode placement, particularly in the lateral leads and in women. This has significant implications when comparing {ECG} in which electrodes have been placed by different clinicians.},

	Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} Most studies of pre-hospital management of {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} have involved physicians accompanying the ambulance crew, or electrocardiogram ({ECG)} transmission to a physician at the base hospital. We sought to determine if Advanced Care Paramedics ({ACPs)} could accurately identify {STEMI} on the pre-hospital {ECG} and contribute to strategies that shorten time to reperfusion.
{METHODS:} A {STEMI} tool was developed to: 1) measure the accuracy of the {ACPs} at diagnosing {STEMI;} and 2) determine the potential time saved if {ACPs} were to independently administer thrombolytic therapy. Using registry data, we subsequently estimated the time saved by initiating thrombolytic therapy in the field compared with in-hospital administration by a physician.
{RESULTS:} Between August 2003 and July 2004, a correct diagnosis of {STEMI} on the pre-hospital {ECG} was confirmed in 63 patients. The performance of the {ACPs} in identifying {STEMI} on the {ECG} resulted in a sensitivity of 95\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI]} 86\%-99\%), a specificity of 96\% (95\% {CI} 94\%-98\%), a positive predictive value ({PPV)} of 82\% (95\% {CI} 71\%-90\%), and a negative predictive value ({NPV)} of 99\% (95\% {CI} 97\%-100\%). {ACP} performance for appropriately using thrombolytic therapy resulted in a sensitivity of 92\% (95\% {CI} 78\%-98\%), a specificity of 97\% (95\% {CI} 94\%-98\%), a {PPV} of 73\% (95\% {CI} 59\%-85\%) and an {NPV} of 99\% (95\% {CI} 97\%-100\%). We estimated that the median time saved by {ACP} administration of thrombolytic therapy would have been 44 minutes.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {ACPs} can be trained to accurately interpret the pre-hospital {ECG} for the diagnosis of {STEMI.} These results are important for the design of regional integrated programs aimed at reducing delays to reperfusion.},

	Abstract = {Objectives 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of timely reperfusion for {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PPCI)} in regional {STEMI} Receiving Center ({SRC)} networks. 
Background 
The American College of Cardiology Door-to-Balloon ({D2B)} Alliance target is a \&gt;75\% rate of {D2B} ≤90 min. Independent initiatives nationwide have organized regional {SRC} networks that coordinate universal access to 9-1-1 with the pre-hospital electrocardiogram ({PH-ECG)} diagnosis of {STEMI} and immediate transport to a {SRC} (designated {PPCI-capable} hospital). 
Methods 
A pooled analysis of 10 independent, prospective, observational registries involving 72 hospitals was performed. Data were collected on all consecutive patients with a {PH-ECG} diagnosis of {STEMI.} The {D2B} and emergency medical services ({EMS)-to-balloon} ({E2B)} times were recorded. 
Results 
Paramedics transported 2,712 patients with a {PH-ECG} diagnosis of {STEMI} directly to the nearest {SRC.} A {PPCI} was performed in 2,053 patients (76\%) with an 86\% rate of {D2B} ≤90 min (95\% confidence interval: 84.4\% to 87.4\%). Secondary analyses of this cohort demonstrated a 50\% rate of {D2B} ≤60 min (n = 1,031), 25\% rate of {D2B} ≤45 min (n = 517), and an 8\% rate of {D2B} ≤30 min (n = 155). A tertiary analysis restricted to 762 of 2,053 (37\%) cases demonstrated a 68\% rate of {E2B} ≤90 min. 
Conclusions 
Ten independent regional {SRC} networks demonstrated a combined 86\% rate of {D2B} ≤90 min, and each region individually surpassed the American College of Cardiology {D2B} Alliance benchmark. In areas with regional {SRC} networks, 9-1-1 provides entire communities with timely access to quality {STEMI} care.},

	Abstract = {{Objectives---To} establish the feasibility of training paramedics to diagnose acute myocardial infarction by {ECG} before hospital admission and whether direct paramedic coronary care admission, arranged by very high frequency ({VHF)} radio communication with the coronary care unit ({CCU)}, would reduce delay of thrombolysis treatment. {Design---Prospective} controlled study. {Setting---District} general hospital {CCU} and a local district ambulance paramedic service. Patients---124 patients with {ECG} evidence of myocardial infarction or ischaemia admitted directly to the {CCU} by the paramedic service were compared with 123 patients admitted by the emergency department and subsequently transferred to the {CCU.} Main outcome {measures---ECG} diagnostic accuracy by paramedics, and interval durations for {CCU} admission and thrombolysis. {Results---ECG} diagnostic accuracy by the paramedics was 87.5\% in the training phase and 92\% in admission. The total call to thrombolysis interval was reduced from 154 to 93 minutes and the "door to needle" interval was reduced from 97 to 37 minutes. {Conclusions---Trained} paramedics can reliably diagnose myocardial infarction by {ECG.} The use of a direct admission procedure, by a {VHF} radio link to the {CCU}, substantially reduces the time interval for thrombolytic treatment after acute myocardial infarction.    Keywords: myocardial infarction;  electrocardiogram;  thrombolysis;  paramedic},

	Abstract = {Objectives  
    This study sought to determine the association of pre-hospital electrocardiograms ({ECGs)} and the timing of reperfusion therapy for patients with {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI).Background}  
    Pre-hospital {ECGs} have been recommended in the management of patients with chest pain transported by emergency medical services ({EMS).Methods}  
    We evaluated patients with {STEMI} from the {NCDR} (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) {ACTION} (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network) registry who were transported by {EMS} from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007. Patients were stratified by the use of pre-hospital {ECGs}, and timing of reperfusion therapy was compared between the 2 {groups.Results}  
    A total of 7,098 of 12,097 patients (58.7\%) utilized {EMS}, and 1,941 of these 7,098 {EMS} transport patients (27.4\%) received a pre-hospital {ECG.} Among the {EMS} transport population, primary percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 92.1\% of patients with a pre-hospital {ECG} versus 86.3\% with an in-hospital {ECG}, whereas fibrinolytic therapy was used in 4.6\% versus 4.2\% of patients. Median door-to-needle times for patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy (19 min vs. 29 min, p = 0.003) and median door-to-balloon times for patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (61 min vs. 75 min, p {\textless} 0.0001) were significantly shorter for patients with a pre-hospital {ECG.} A suggestive trend for a lower risk of in-hospital mortality was observed with pre-hospital {ECG} use (adjusted odds ratio: 0.80, 95\% confidence interval: 0.63 to {1.01).Conclusions}  
    Only one-quarter of these patients transported by {EMS} receive a pre-hospital {ECG.} The use of a pre-hospital {ECG} was associated with a greater use of reperfusion therapy, faster reperfusion times, and a suggested trend for a lower risk of mortality.},

@article{huang_st_2011,
	Abstract = {It is well accepted that early reperfusion is beneficial in patients with acute myocardial infarction presenting with {ST} elevation ({STE).} Earlier studies suggested lack of beneficial effects in patients presenting without {STE} and even with {ST} depression. Currently, time to reperfusion is considered to be a quality of care measure, and the latest American College of {Cardiology/American} Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of {STE} acute myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} emphasize that the physician at the emergency department should make reperfusion decisions within 10 minutes of performing the initial electrocardiogram ({ECG).} However, not all {ECGs} with {STE} necessarily reflect transmural infarction from acute thrombotic occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery, as a large number of patients presenting with compatible symptoms have baseline {STE.} In some cases a pattern of benign nonischemic {STE} ({NISTE)} can be recognized fairly easily. Other times, differentiating between true {STEMI} and {NISTE} may be difficult. It should be remembered that patients presenting with chest pain and showing benign pattern of {NISTE} (eg, ``early repolarization'' or {STE} secondary to left ventricular hypertrophy) may have true ischemic pain and non-{STE} myocardial infarction or even {STEMI} on top of the baseline benign pattern. It seems that, in the ``real world,'' the ability of physicians to differentiate {NISTE} from {STEMI} based on the presenting {ECG} pattern widely varies and depends on the prevalence of baseline {NISTE} in the patient population. Further studies are needed to assess the ability of various {ECG} criteria to accurately differentiate between {STEMI} and {NISTE.}},

@article{gu_conditions_2008,
	Abstract = {{Background/Objectives.}
A rapid diagnosis of {ST-segment} elevation myocardial infarction ({STEMI)} is mandatory for optimal treatment. However, a small proportion of patients with suspected {STEMI} suffer from other conditions. Although case reports have described these conditions, a contemporary systematic analysis is lacking. We report the incidence, clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with suspected {STEMI} referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI)} with a final diagnosis other than {STEMI.}

Methods.
From January 2004 to July 2005, 820 consecutive patients were included with suspected {STEMI} who were referred for primary {PCI} to a university medical centre, based on a predefined protocol. Clinical characteristics, final diagnosis and outcome were obtained from patient charts and databases.

Results.
In 19 patients (2.3\%), a final diagnosis other than myocardial infarction was established: coronary aneurysm (n=1), (myo)pericarditis (n=5), cardiomyopathy (n=2), Brugada syndrome (n=1), aortic stenosis (n=1), aortic dissection (n=3), subarachnoidal haemorrhage (n=2), pneumonia (n=1), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=1), mediastinal tumour (n=1), and peritonitis after recent abdominal surgery (n=1). These patients less often reported previous symptoms of angina (p{\textless}0.001), smoking (p{\textless}0.05) and a positive family history of cardiovascular diseases (p{\textless}0.05) than {STEMI} patients. Mortality at 30 days was 16\%.

Conclusion.
A 2.3\% incidence of conditions mimicking {STEMI} was found in patients referred for primary {PCI.} A high clinical suspicion of conditions mimicking {STEMI} remains necessary. (Neth Heart J 2008;16:325-31.)},

@article{widimsky_prevalence_2006,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}
Acute {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction in patients with normal coronary arteries has previously been described, but coronary angiography in these patients was performed after the acute phase of the infarction. It is possible that these patients did not have normal angiograms during the acute phase (transient coronary thrombosis or spasm were usually suspected to be the cause). Information on the prevalence of truly normal coronary angiograms during the acute phase of a suspected {ST-elevation} myocardial infarction is lacking.

{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}
The {PRimary} Angioplasty in patients transferred from General community hospitals to specialized {PTCA} Units with or without Emergency thrombolysis-1 ({PRAGUE-1)} and {PRAGUE-2} studies enrolled 1150 patients with {ST-elevation} acute myocardial infarction, in whom 625 coronary angiograms were performed within 2 h of the initial electrocardiogram. A simultaneous registry included an additional 379 coronary angiograms performed during the {ST-elevation} phase of a suspected myocardial infarction. Thus, a total of 1004 angiograms were retrospectively analyzed. A normal coronary angiogram was defined as one with the absence of any visible angiographic signs of atherosclerosis, thrombosis or spontaneous spasm.

{RESULTS}
Normal coronary angiograms were obtained for 26 patients (2.6\%). Among these, the diagnosis at discharge was a small myocardial infarction in seven patients (0.7\%), acute (peri)myocarditis in five patients, dilated cardiomyopathy in four patients, hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy in three patients, pulmonary embolism in two patients and misinterpretation of the electrocardiogram (ie, no cardiac disease) in five patients. Seven patients with small infarctions underwent angiography within 30 min to 90 min of complete relief of the signs of acute ischemia, and thus, angiograms during pain were not taken. None of the 898 patients catheterized during ongoing symptoms of ischemia had a normal coronary angiogram. Spontaneous coronary spasm as the only cause (without underlying coronary atherosclerosis) for the evolving infarction was not seen among these 898 patients. Thus, the causes of the seven small infarcts in patients with normal angiograms remain uncertain.

{CONCLUSIONS}
The observed prevalence of normal coronary angiography in patients presenting with acute chest pain and {ST} elevations was 2.6\%. Most of these cases were misdiagnoses, not infarctions. A normal angiogram during a biochemically confirmed infarction is extremely rare (0.7\%) and was not seen during the ongoing symptoms of ischemia.},

We examined the effect of breast tissue protuberance on {ECG} amplitudes using {ECG} and anthropometric data on 6,814 women included in the Atherosclerosis Research in Communities Study ({ARIC).} The R wave amplitudes in anterolateral chest leads and the {SokolowLyon} voltage decreased (P \&lt; .001 for all), and {RaVL} and the Cornell voltage increased significantly with increasing breast protuberance (P \&lt; .001 for all). However, these effects were small (15 {μV} or less for each 1-cm increment in breast protuberance), and R2 values were less than .01, indicating that breast protuberance alone explained less than 1 \% of {ECG} amplitude variations. When chest size and breast protuberance estimates were entered simultaneously into a multivariate regression model, chest size appeared to dominate, and model R2 values increased for positive associations with {RaVL} (R2 = .12) and the Cornell voltage (R2 = .04). Combined model R2 values remained ⩽.01 for all other {ECG} amplitudes. A detailed step-by-step standardized electrode placement procedure was formulated. Because of the difficulties encountered in locating the left midclavicular line by visual inspection, we introduced well-defined procedures for identification and documentation of lateral chest electrode placement locations as a quality control method for clinical trials. Population data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey on the distributions by sex and race of chest electrode V4 and V6 locations and anthropometric data on chest size and shape are presented in order to facilitate evaluation of the comparability of electrode placement procedures in various studies and for quality control in clinical trials. It is concluded that standardized procedures to document chest electrode placement locations are feasible. Breast tissue appears to have a practically negligible effect on {ECG} amplitudes, and in women, the placement of chest electrodes on the breast rather than under the breast is recommended in order to facilitate the precision of electrode placement at the correct horizontal level and at the correct lateral positions.},

	Abstract = {Accurate precordial electrode placement can be difficult in emergency situations leading either to loss of time or diminished accuracy. A possible solution is the quasi-orthogonal {EASI} lead system, with only five electrodes and easily defined landmarks to provide a derived 12-lead electrocardiogram ({ECG).} The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that precordial waveforms in {EASI-derived} {ECGs} have no greater deviation from those in gold standard {ECGs}, than do the precordial waveforms in paramedic acquired standard {ECGs.} Twenty paramedics applied the standard precordial electrodes employing the routine procedure. A certified {ECG} technician applied the 6 standard precordial electrodes in their correct gold standard positions, and the {EASI} electrodes. 12-lead {ECGs} were obtained from the paramedics' standard leads, and derived from the {EASI} leads, for comparison with the gold standard {ECG.} In each precordial lead recording, 6 computer-measured {QRS-T} waveform parameters were considered. Differences between {ΔEASI-gold} standard versus Δparamedic-gold standard were calculated for every waveform in every lead resulting in 720 comparisons. {EASI} and paramedic results were ``equally accurate'' in 47\%, the paramedic was more accurate in 31\%, and {EASI} was more accurate in the remaining 22\%. The differences from gold standard recording of precordial waveforms in {ECGs} derived from the {EASI} leads and those acquired via paramedic-applied standard electrodes are similar. The results suggest that the {EASI} lead system may provide an alternative to the standard {ECG} precordial leads to facilitate data acquisition and possibly save valuable time in emergency situations.},

	Abstract = {Purpose. To examine the effect of instructional format on medical students' learning of {ECG} diagnosis. Method. Two experiments employed different learning and practice methods. In the first, students were randomly allocated to one of two instructional approaches, one organized around features (e.g., {QRS} voltage) and the other around diagnostic categories (e.g., bundle branch blocks), followed by a practice phase. In the second experiment, the instruction was standardized, and students were randomly allocated to one of two practice phases, either ``contrastive'' where examples from various categories are mixed together, or ``non-contrastive'' where all the examples in a single category are practiced in a single block. Results. In the first experiment, there was no significant differences in students' diagnostic accuracy on novel {ECG} examples. In the second experiment, students exposed to the contrastive approach in the practice phase had superior diagnostic accuracy (46\%) compared to 30\% accuracy for the non-contrastive session, p Conclusion. These experiments highlight two important features in the design of instructional materials. First, learning around the features of the problem (analogous to problem -- based learning) may have no advantages over learning the category. Second, the design and organization of deliberate practice can result in significant learning gain.},

	Abstract = {Objectives: Prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram ({PHECG)} interpretation and advance emergency department ({ED)} notification may improve time-to-treatment intervals for a variety of treatment strategies to improve outcome in acute myocardial infarction. Despite consensus guidelines recommending this intervention, few emergency medical services ({EMS)} employ this. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to report whether mortality or treatment time intervals improved when compared with standard {care.Methods:} The authors used the Cochrane strategy to search {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, Current Contents, Dissertation Abstracts, Cochrane Library, and Index of Scientific and Technical Proceedings. Bibliographies and grant-agency Websites were reviewed, and primary investigators and industry were contacted for published and unpublished studies. Inclusion criteria included {PHECG} and advance {ED} notification versus standard {EMS} care; controlled trials; English only; and evaluation of treatment time intervals, all-cause mortality, or both. Study selection was hierarchical, blinded, and independent. Agreement at each level of review was evaluated by using a kappa statistic. Study quality was measured with a validated scale and was interpreted by two independent {reviewers.Results:} A total of 1,283 citations were identified, and five studies met the inclusion criteria. The weighted kappa for selection was 0.61 (standard error [{SE]}, 0.045) for titles, 0.63 ({SE}, 0.051) for abstracts, and 0.79 ({SE}, 0.146) for full articles. Mean study quality measures by two independent reviewers were 6.0/15 and 5.5/15 (correlation coefficient, 0.85; p = 0.06). {PHECG} and advance {ED} notification increased the weighted mean on-scene time by 1.2 minutes (95\% confidence interval [95\% {CI]} =−0.84 to 3.2). The weighted mean door-to-needle interval was shortened by 36.1 minutes (95\% {CI} = 9.3 to 63.0: range of means, 22--48 minutes vs. 50--97 minutes). One study reported all-cause mortality, with a statistically nonsignificant reduction from 15.6\% to {8.4\%.Conclusions:} For patients with {AMI}, the literature would suggest that {PHECG} and advanced {ED} notification reduces in hospital time to fibrinolysis. One controlled trial found no difference in mortality with this out-of-hospital intervention.},

	Abstract = {{CONTEXT}

Laboratory studies suggest that in the setting of cardiac ischemia, immediate intravenous glucose-insulin-potassium ({GIK)} reduces ischemia-related arrhythmias and myocardial injury. Clinical trials have not consistently shown these benefits, possibly due to delayed administration.


{OBJECTIVE}

To test out-of hospital emergency medical service ({EMS)} administration of {GIK} in the first hours of suspected acute coronary syndromes ({ACS).}


{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}

Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind effectiveness trial in 13 {US} cities (36 {EMS} agencies), from December 2006 through July 31, 2011, in which paramedics, aided by electrocardiograph ({ECG)-based} decision support, randomized 911 (871 enrolled) patients (mean age, 63.6 years; 71.0\% men) with high probability of {ACS.}


{INTERVENTION}

Intravenous {GIK} solution (n = 411) or identical-appearing 5\% glucose placebo (n = 460) administered by paramedics in the out-of-hospital setting and continued for 12 hours.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

The prespecified primary end point was progression of {ACS} to myocardial infarction ({MI)} within 24 hours, as assessed by biomarkers and {ECG} evidence. Prespecified secondary end points included survival at 30 days and a composite of prehospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest or in-hospital mortality, analyzed by intent-to-treat and by presentation with {ST-segment} elevation.


{RESULTS}

There was no significant difference in the rate of progression to {MI} among patients who received {GIK} (n = 200; 48.7\%) vs those who received placebo (n = 242; 52.6\%) (odds ratio [{OR]}, 0.88; 95\% {CI}, 0.66-1.13; P = .28). Thirty-day mortality was 4.4\% with {GIK} vs 6.1\% with placebo (hazard ratio [{HR]}, 0.72; 95\% {CI}, 0.40-1.29; P = .27). The composite of cardiac arrest or in-hospital mortality occurred in 4.4\% with {GIK} vs 8.7\% with placebo ({OR}, 0.48; 95\% {CI}, 0.27-0.85; P = .01). Among patients with {ST-segment} elevation (163 with {GIK} and 194 with placebo), progression to {MI} was 85.3\% with {GIK} vs 88.7\% with placebo ({OR}, 0.74; 95\% {CI}, 0.40-1.38; P = .34); 30-day mortality was 4.9\% with {GIK} vs 7.7\% with placebo ({HR}, 0.63; 95\% {CI}, 0.27-1.49; P = .29). The composite outcome of cardiac arrest or in-hospital mortality was 6.1\% with {GIK} vs 14.4\% with placebo ({OR}, 0.39; 95\% {CI}, 0.18-0.82; P = .01). Serious adverse events occurred in 6.8\% (n = 28) with {GIK} vs 8.9\% (n = 41) with placebo (P = .26).


{CONCLUSIONS}

Among patients with suspected {ACS}, out-of-hospital administration of intravenous {GIK}, compared with glucose placebo, did not reduce progression to {MI.} Compared with placebo, {GIK} administration was not associated with improvement in 30-day survival but was associated with lower rates of the composite outcome of cardiac arrest or in-hospital mortality.

@article{selker_use_1998,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Approximately 6 million {U.S.} patients present to emergency departments annually with symptoms suggesting acute cardiac ischemia. Triage decisions for these patients are important but remain difficult.


{OBJECTIVE}

To test whether computerized prediction of the probability of acute ischemia, used with electrocardiography, improves the accuracy of triage decisions.


{DESIGN}

Controlled clinical trial.


{SETTING}

10 hospital emergency departments in the midwestern, southeastern, and northeastern United States.


{PATIENTS}

10689 patients with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of acute cardiac ischemia.


{INTERVENTION}

The probability of acute ischemia predicted by the acute cardiac ischemia time-insensitive predictive instrument ({ACI-TIPI)}, either automatically printed or not printed on patients' electrocardiograms.


{MEASUREMENTS}

Emergency department triage to a coronary care unit ({CCU)}, telemetry unit, ward, or home. Other measurements were the bed capacity of the {CCU} relative to that of the telemetry unit; training or supervision status of the triaging physician; and patient diagnoses and outcomes based on clinical, electrocardiographic, and creatine kinase data.


{RESULTS}

For patients without cardiac ischemia, in hospitals with high-capacity {CCUs} and relatively low-capacity cardiac telemetry units, use of {ACI-TIPI} was associated with a reduction in {CCU} admissions from 15\% to 12\%, a change of -16\% (95\% {CI}, -30\% to 0\%), and an increase in emergency department discharges to home from 49\% to 52\%, a change of 6\% ({CI}, 0\% to 14\%; overall P=0.09). Across all hospitals, for patients evaluated by unsupervised residents, use of {ACI-TIPI} was associated with a reduction in {CCU} admissions from 14\% to 10\%, a change of -32\% ({CI}, -55\% to 3\%); a reduction in telemetry unit admissions from 39\% to 31\%, a change of -20\% ({CI}, -34\% to -2\%); and an increase in discharges to home from 45\% to 56\%, a change of 25\% ({CI}, 8\% to 45\%; overall P=0.008). Among patients with stable angina, in hospitals with high-capacity {CCUs}, use of {ACI-TIPI} was associated with a reduction in {CCU} admissions from 26\% to 13\%, a change of -50\% ({CI}, -70\% to -17\%), and an increase in discharges to home from 20\% to 22\%, a change of 10\% ({CI}, -29\% to 71\%; overall P=0.02). At hospitals with high-capacity telemetry units, use of {ACI-TIPI} was associated with a reduction in telemetry unit admissions from 68\% to 59\%, a change of -14\% ({CI}, -27\% to 1\%), and an increase in emergency department discharges to home from 10\% to 21\%, a change of 100\% ({CI}, 22\% to 230\%; overall P=0.02). Among patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina, use of {ACI-TIPI} did not change appropriate admission (96\%) to the {CCU} or telemetry unit at hospitals with high-capacity {CCUs} or telemetry units.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Use of {ACI-TIPI} was associated with reduced hospitalization among emergency department patients without acute cardiac ischemia. This result varied as expected according to the {CCU} and cardiac telemetry unit capacities and physician supervision at individual hospitals. Appropriate admission for unstable angina or acute infarction was not affected. If {ACI-TIPI} is used widely in the United States, its potential incremental impact may be more than 200000 fewer unnecessary hospitalizations and more than 100000 fewer unnecessary {CCU} admissions.},

@article{selker_use_2002,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Deciding which patients should receive thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ({PTCA)} for acute myocardial infarction ({AMI)} can be difficult, especially for less-obvious candidates and when consulting physicians are off site.


{OBJECTIVE}

To test whether the electrocardiograph-based Thrombolytic Predictive Instrument ({TPI)} improves use of thrombolytic and overall reperfusion therapy.


{DESIGN}

22-month randomized, controlled, clinical effectiveness trial.


{SETTING}

Emergency departments at 28 urban, suburban, and rural hospitals in the United States.


{PATIENTS}

Persons presenting to the emergency department with {AMI} and {ST-segment} elevation on an electrocardiogram ({ECG).}


{INTERVENTION}

{TPI} predictions automatically printed on {ECG} text headers.


{MEASUREMENTS}

Percentages of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy, thrombolytic therapy within 1 hour of initial {ECG}, and overall reperfusion (thrombolytic therapy or {PTCA).}


{RESULTS}

Of 2875 patients with {AMI}, 1243 (43.2\%) had {ST-segment} elevation. Of these, 1197 were randomly assigned to study groups; 732 (61.2\%) had inferior {AMI}, and 465 (38.8\%) had anterior {AMI.} A total of 60.5\% of controls and 62.1\% of {TPI} patients (P = 0.2) received thrombolytic therapy, 52.5\% of controls and 53.3\% of {TPI} patients received thrombolytic therapy within 1 hour (P {\textgreater} 0.2), and 67.6\% of controls and 70.3\% of {TPI} patients received overall reperfusion (P = 0.2). Of patients with inferior {AMI} in the control group versus the {TPI} group, 61.1\% versus 67.6\% (P = 0.03) received thrombolytic therapy, 53.2\% versus 58.6\% (P = 0.08) received thrombolytic therapy within 1 hour, and 67.7\% versus 74.7\% (P = 0.03) received overall reperfusion. Of patients with anterior {AMI} in the control group versus the {TPI} group, 59.5\% versus 53.9\% (P {\textgreater} 0.2) received thrombolytic therapy, 51.4\% versus 45.3\% (P {\textgreater} 0.2) received thrombolytic therapy within 1 hour, and 67.6\% versus 63.8\% (P {\textgreater} 0.2) received overall reperfusion. Among women (n = 398) in the control group versus the {TPI} group, 48.1\% versus 58.2\% (P = 0.03) received thrombolytic therapy, 40.5\% versus 48.4\% (P = 0.10) received thrombolytic therapy within 1 hour, and 55.7\% versus 65.7\% (P = 0.04) received overall reperfusion. Of patients who required physician consultation by telephone (n = 271) in the control group versus the {TPI} group, 47.3\% versus 63.2\% (P = 0.01) received thrombolytic therapy, 41.1\% versus 53.6\% (P = 0.04) received thrombolytic therapy within 1 hour, and 50.7\% versus 66.4\% (P = 0.01) received overall reperfusion.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The {TPI} increased use of thrombolytic therapy, use of thrombolytic therapy within 1 hour, and use of overall coronary reperfusion by 11\% to 12\% for patients with inferior {AMI}, 18\% to 22\% for women, and 30\% to 34\% for patients with an off-site physician. Although its effect was minimal on patients with high baseline reperfusion rates, the {TPI} increased use and timeliness of reperfusion in often-missed groups and when involved physicians were off site.},

@article{thabane_tutorial_2010,
	Abstract = {Pilot studies for phase {III} trials - which are comparative randomized trials designed to provide preliminary evidence on the clinical efficacy of a drug or intervention - are routinely performed in many clinical areas. Also commonly know as "feasibility" or "vanguard" studies, they are designed to assess the safety of treatment or interventions; to assess recruitment potential; to assess the feasibility of international collaboration or coordination for multicentre trials; to increase clinical experience with the study medication or intervention for the phase {III} trials. They are the best way to assess feasibility of a large, expensive full-scale study, and in fact are an almost essential pre-requisite. Conducting a pilot prior to the main study can enhance the likelihood of success of the main study and potentially help to avoid doomed main studies. The objective of this paper is to provide a detailed examination of the key aspects of pilot studies for phase {III} trials including: 1) the general reasons for conducting a pilot study; 2) the relationships between pilot studies, proof-of-concept studies, and adaptive designs; 3) the challenges of and misconceptions about pilot studies; 4) the criteria for evaluating the success of a pilot study; 5) frequently asked questions about pilot studies; 7) some ethical aspects related to pilot studies; and 8) some suggestions on how to report the results of pilot investigations using the {CONSORT} format.},

@article{hanson_identifying_2006,
	Abstract = {Background and objectives
After an acute myocardial infarction ({AMI)} prehospital thrombolysis ({PHT)} reduces mortality compared with inhospital thrombolysis. In practice, a relatively small proportion of the total population with {AMI} receives {PHT.} This study was designed to identify the current barriers to {PHT.}

Methods
A retrospective practice review of 57 consecutive patients treated in or before arrival at a district general hospital emergency department. All patients received thrombolysis for an {AMI.}

Results
The main barriers to delivery of {PHT} appear to be the inclusion and exclusion criteria laid out in the ambulance service central guidelines. Despite recent widening of the inclusion criteria, 54\% of patients eligible for immediate treatment on arrival in hospital either received or were eligible for {PHT.}

Conclusion
To increase the number of patients who are eligible for {PHT} these guidelines need to be revised further in line with inhospital criteria for thrombolysis.},
