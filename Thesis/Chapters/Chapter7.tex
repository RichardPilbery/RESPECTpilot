The RESPECT pilot study has demonstrated that it is possible to conduct a randomised crossover trial to test the accuracy of STEMI recognition by paramedics, using an online assessment tool. The next step is to calculate the sample size for an adequately powered main study. If this is not prohibitively high, the main study should be conducted to see whether the results suggested from the pilot data can be replicated. The sample size calculation, confirmation of the appropriate model that should be utilised, and an explanation for the smaller than expected standard errors and confidence intervals for the adjusted GLM, will require the services of a statistician with an expertise in cluster randomised controlled trials.
