\textit{As with many interventions intended to prevent ill health, the effectiveness of parachutes has not been subjected to rigorous evaluation by using randomised controlled trials. Advocates of evidence based medicine have criticised the adoption of interventions evaluated by using only observational data.  We think that everyone might benefit if the most radical protagonists of evidence based medicine organised and participated in a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover trial of the parachute.}

\textbf{Background}
Timely diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) depends on accurate interpretation of the 12-lead ECG by paramedics. Computer interpretation messages on ECGs are often provided, but the effect they exert on paramedics' decision making is not known. The pilot study objective is to assess the feasibility of conducting a trial using an online assessment tool, to determine the effect of computer interpretation messages on paramedics' diagnosis of STEMI from a 12-lead ECG.

\textbf{Methods}
The RESPECT pilot study is a randomised cross-over trial utilising a bespoke, web-based assessment tool. Participants were randomly allocated 12 of 48 ECGs, with an equal mix of correct and incorrect computer interpretation messages, and STEMI and STEMI-mimics. 

\textbf{Results}
254 Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) registered paramedics in the UK consented into the study, 205 completing the first phase and 156 completing phase two; an attrition rate of 24\%. The ICC for participants was 0.05 and for ECGs, 0.41. Overall, participant accuracy was 80\% when the computer message was visible and 79\% when hidden. In the subset of correct computer interpretations, accuracy was 84\% (message hidden) and 87\% (message visible). The subset of incorrect computer interpretations resulted in an accuracy of 77\% (message hidden) and 71\% (message visible). Overall, the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of a correct interpretation with a computer message was 0.94 (95\%CI 0.77--1.10, p=0.44) and adjusted OR, 0.92 (95\%CI 0.77--1.10, p=0.38). For the subset of correct computer interpretation, the unadjusted OR was 1.31 (95\%CI 1.01--1.71, p=0.04) and adjusted OR, 1.42 (95\%CI 1.06--1.89, p=0.02). Incorrect computer interpretations had an unadjusted OR of 0.76 (95\%CI 0.61--0.93, p=0.01) and adjusted OR, 0.70 (95\%CI 0.56--0.88, p=0.00).

\textbf{Conclusion}
Data from the pilot study suggests the main study is feasible, assuming the sample size calculation for the main study is not prohibitively large.

First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor, Steve Goodacre, for his enthu-siasm and advice, and for re-reading endless drafts of various chapters of this dissertation.  In addition, he and Francis Morris assumed the role of `senior doctors with specialist knowledge of ECGs', providing the reference standard for the ECGs used in the study.  Indeed, this study would not have got very far without the ECGs used in the assessment tool and thanks need to go to Tom Bouthillet and Chris Watford for providing a number of these.

Whoever advised me to consult a statistician during the planning of a study also deserves much praise, although I cannot recollect where I first heard those words.  A seemingly simple study that recorded binary responses to a question about the presence of STEMI, turned out to have a rather complex analysis, involving clustering and cross-classified modelling, and I am indebted to Dawn Tere for assisting me through the minefield of binary logistic regression with random effects.  

Friends and colleagues also deserve thanks, not least those who gave up their time to undertake the ECG `quiz' and generate the data I needed, as does the College of Paramedics Research and Development Committee, who were very supportive in advertising the study.
